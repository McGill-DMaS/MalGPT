    "Explanation": "The file, identified as \"RarExt.dll,\" is classified as benign based on the comprehensive analysis. This determination is supported by its classification as a WinRAR shell extension with legitimate signature information, indicating its association with the WinRAR software product and lack of malicious behavior. All 72 antivirus engines, including major names like McAfee, Kaspersky, and Malwarebytes, returned an \"undetected\" status. Sigma rules identified some potential suspicious actions, but these are not sufficient to override the overwhelming consensus of non-malicious activity. Lastly, sandbox analysis from Zenbox confirms the file as \"harmless,\" further supporting its benign nature and reducing concerns around malware-related risks."

    "File Name": "vt-origin_15810__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The analyzed file is classified as malicious due to significant antivirus engine detections, with 48 engines marking it as harmful, including MicroWorld-eScan identifying it as \"Application.Bundler.KJ\". This detection is supported by reports from other antivirus vendors like McAfee, Symantec, and Kaspersky, identifying Trojans or unwanted applications and bundlers related to \"DownloadAdmin\", which is often associated with potentially unwanted programs (PUPs) and adware. The file's digital signature from \"Code Techno\" is not time valid, adding to its suspicion. However, there are no specific URLs, IP addresses, or sandbox behaviors mentioned in the report, nor detailed MITRE ATT&CK tactics or techniques. Overall, the high number of malicious detections and the file's characteristics suggest a risk of unwanted software installation and potential adware distribution, emphasizing caution against such files."

    "File Name": "vt-origin_21403__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file report indicates that the executable is malicious, predominantly identified as part of the \"DownloadAdmin\" malware family. The majority of antivirus engines flagged it as malicious, with detections labeled as adware, riskware, and potentially unwanted programs (PUPs), emphasizing behaviors like unwanted downloads and administrative privilege manipulation. The file's code-signing certificate is not time-valid, which further suggests suspicious intent. Despite this, the file doesn't exhibit specific behaviors like persistence or communication with command-and-control (C2) servers typically assessed in sandbox environments, indicating potential risks of adware or unwanted software deployment rather than advanced cyber threats."

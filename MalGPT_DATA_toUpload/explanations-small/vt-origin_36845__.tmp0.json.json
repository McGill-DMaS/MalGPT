    "File Name": "vt-origin_36845__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file is classified as malicious, primarily due to its detection by multiple antivirus engines that identified it as various forms of adware and potentially unwanted programs (PUA), such as \"W32.HfsAdware.DD11\" and \"Downloader.Win32.DownloAdmin.gen.\" Detection statistics from 48 engines marked it as malicious, with no suspicions or harmless reports. Key indicators supporting this classification include the invalid digital certificate from Code Techno, along with multiple engines linking it to the \"DownloadAdmin\" family, which often involves downloading unwanted software. No specific YARA rules or sandbox results are mentioned, but the overwhelming consensus from antivirus scans indicates a high-risk profile. The file\u2019s behavior suggests a focus on unwanted software distribution, aligning with certain MITRE ATT&CK techniques related to persistence and execution of unauthorized code."

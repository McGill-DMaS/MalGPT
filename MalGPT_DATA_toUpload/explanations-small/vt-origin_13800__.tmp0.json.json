    "File Name": "vt-origin_13800__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file is classified as malicious, primarily identified as a member of the \"DownloadAdmin\" adware or potentially unwanted application (PUA) family. Numerous antivirus engines, including McAfee, Symantec, and Microsoft, flagged it as malicious with categories like adware and PUA, indicating risk from unwanted installations and user disruptions. The signature verification failed due to expired certificates, hinting at potentially tampered or outdated software. Additionally, no specific URLs or domains were noted in the report, but the presence of bundled software or advertisement injection is suggested. The combination of detection by multiple security tools and the certification issues strongly suggests that the file contains malicious traits that could compromise system integrity or interfere with user operations."

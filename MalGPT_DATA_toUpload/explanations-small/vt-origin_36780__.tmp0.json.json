The scan results highlighted detections of adware, bundlers, and trojans by well-known antivirus providers like McAfee, Kaspersky, and Microsoft. No specific behaviors, such as persistence mechanisms or command and control communications, were noted in the report, aligning with typical adware functionality, which often involves intrusive ads and potentially unwanted software bundling."

    "File Name": "vt-origin_37814__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file is classified as malicious, primarily due to being identified by many antivirus engines as associated with adware and potentially unwanted programs (PUPs), such as W32.HfsAdware.DD11 and PUA.Codetechno.Gen. Forty-eight engines flagged it as malicious, showing a consistent pattern of undesirable behavior across multiple platforms. The file is tied to the Code Techno signature, which is no longer valid, weakening its authenticity. There's no specific mention of other indicators such as URLs or IPs, and no YARA rules or MITRE ATT&CK tactics are cited in the analysis, but the file's behavior aligns with downloaders and PUPs, indicating risks like unwanted software downloads and potential system slowdown."

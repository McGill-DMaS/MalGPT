    "Explanation": "The file analyzed in this report is classified as malicious, primarily identified as belonging to the Emotet malware family. This classification is supported by detection statistics, with 25 antivirus engines marking it as malicious, reporting signatures such as \"Trojan.Emotet.GL\" and \"Win32:Malware-gen.\" No URLs, IPs, or additional indicators of compromise are mentioned, but the detection consistency across several engines suggests known malicious behaviors. The report does not provide specific YARA rules, sandbox analysis, or MITRE ATT&CK tactics, but based on the nature of Emotet, potential risks may include data theft and being part of a botnet."

    "Explanation": "The file is classified as benign, as indicated by the comprehensive analysis results: all antivirus engines reported it as \"undetected\" with no engines flagging it as malicious or suspicious. The analysis statistics confirm that 68 engines classify it as undetected, and no observable harmful behavior was noted in sandbox verdicts, which categorize the file as harmless. While there was a low-level Sigma rule match for code integrity failures, this does not significantly detract from the benign conclusion. No specific malware family or malicious behavior indicators were observed, and there are no associated URLs, IPs, or domains suggesting malicious activity."

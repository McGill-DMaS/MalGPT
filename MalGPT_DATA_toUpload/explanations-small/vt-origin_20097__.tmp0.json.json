    "File Name": "vt-origin_20097__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file is classified as malicious, primarily associated with adware and potentially unwanted programs (PUPs), such as the DownloadAdmin and Adware families. The last analysis includes 49 detections by antivirus engines, including recognitions from Bkav, MicroWorld-eScan, and Symantec, among others. Additionally, the file was flagged for having an invalidated code signing certificate, indicating a possible attempt to disguise malicious behavior. The presence of numerous imports from libraries like ADVAPI32.dll and USER32.dll suggests capability for registry manipulation and user interface interactions, which align with adware activity. These attributes underline the file's risk of unauthorized data access and resource manipulation."

    "File Name": "vt-origin_31453__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file is classified as malicious, primarily identified as part of the Solimba adware/malware family, and is associated with multiple detections across 52 antivirus engines, including well-known ones like McAfee, Symantec, and Kaspersky. The key reason for classification is the presence of signatures for potentially unwanted programs (PUP) and adware, consistent with Solimba variants. The file is an executable designed for Windows and is signed, although the certificate is no longer time valid. No further behavioral information such as network connections or MITRE ATT&CK techniques are detailed, suggesting a typical adware risk involving unwanted software installation and system persistence without complex malicious behavior."

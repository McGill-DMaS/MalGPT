    "File Name": "vt-origin_11610__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file in this report is classified as malicious, identified primarily as part of the Solimba adware family, which is a known unwanted software category. Detection by antivirus engines is high, with 59 out of 71 engines identifying it as malicious. Key indicators include its classification as adware and its association with unwanted program generators like Firseria. The file's digital signature, though present, is counteracted by a range of detections that infer malicious behavior, such as being flagged as a Trojan.GenericKD and a PUA (Potentially Unwanted Application). These factors suggest the file compromises user systems primarily through adware deployment and potentially unwanted actions."

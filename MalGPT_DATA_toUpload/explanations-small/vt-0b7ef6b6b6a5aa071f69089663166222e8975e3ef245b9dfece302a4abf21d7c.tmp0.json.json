    "Explanation": "The file in question is classified as benign. All 66 antivirus engines marked it as undetected, with no indications of suspicious or malicious behavior. There are no specific URLs, IPs, domains, YARA rules, or signatures associated with the file to suggest otherwise. Although a sandbox analysis by DAS-Security Orcas flagged it as malicious, no further evidence from other sources supports this claim. The lack of behavioral indicators or attacks such as persistence or encryption suggests the file does not pose a security risk."

    "Explanation": "The file report indicates a 'NotFoundError', meaning no relevant information is available for analysis. This lack of data prevents classification as either benign or malicious. Consequently, no detection statistics, malware family, key indicators, YARA rules, sandbox results, or MITRE ATT&CK tactics are presented, leading to no discernible behaviors or risks. Essentially, the file's status remains undetermined due to insufficient information."

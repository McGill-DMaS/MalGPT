    "File Name": "vt-origin_23563__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file is classified as malicious due to its identification as adware and trojans by several antivirus engines, including McAfee, Symantec, and Kaspersky, which detected variants such as Adware.Multiplug.DT and Trojan.Win32.Generic. Key indicators include the high rate of malicious detections (51 out of 66 engines flagged it as malicious) and consistent identification of adware and potentially unwanted applications (PUA) from multiple sources. Although specific YARA rules or sandbox results are not mentioned, the presence of adware components suggests risk of persistent unwanted ads and potential data breach. The behaviors indicate tactics aligned with the delivery of unwanted software bundles, highlighting the risk of unauthorized software installations and potential system degradation."

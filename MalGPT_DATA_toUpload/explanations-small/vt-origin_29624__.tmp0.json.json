    "Explanation": "The file in question is classified as malicious, with 48 antivirus engines flagging it as such and 15 engines detecting nothing. It belongs to the 'DownloadAdmin' family, often associated with potentially unwanted programs (PUPs) and adware, as indicated by multiple detections as adware or riskware. The analysis shows it is signed with an expired certificate from 'Code Techno', reducing its legitimacy. Key risk behaviors include downloading additional software and potentially performing unwanted actions on the host system, such as displaying ads or altering user settings. No specific URLs, IPs, or MITRE ATT&CK tactics are mentioned, but the presence of adware behaviors suggests privacy and security risks."

    "Explanation": "The file is classified as benign. It was subjected to analysis by numerous antivirus engines, with only one (MaxSecure) labeling it as malicious for detecting a generic Trojan signature; however, this appears to be a false positive as 70 other engines reported the file as undetected. No malicious behavior or network communications such as suspicious URLs or IP addresses were noted, and no relevant YARA rules or sandbox detections, like persistence or command and control activity, were reported. The file, identified as a PE32 DLL, shows no association with known malware families or behaviors listed in MITRE ATT&CK tactics."

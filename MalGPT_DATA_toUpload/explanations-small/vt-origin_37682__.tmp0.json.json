    "File Name": "vt-origin_37682__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The analyzed file is classified as malicious, primarily due to its detection by 48 antivirus engines out of a total of those analyzed, with results indicating various threats such as \"W32.HfsAdware.DD11,\" \"Application.Generic,\" and \"Trojan.Win32.Generic.\" Multiple instances categorize it as potentially unwanted software, known as \"PUA\" (Potentially Unwanted Application), suggesting it is considered a download manager often associated with adware or unwanted programs. The file is signed by a certificate that is not time valid, raising suspicion about its legitimacy. No specific URLs, IP addresses, or sandbox behaviors are detailed, nor are there explicit mentions of MITRE ATT&CK tactics, but the high number of detections and the nature of those detections suggest significant risk if executed."

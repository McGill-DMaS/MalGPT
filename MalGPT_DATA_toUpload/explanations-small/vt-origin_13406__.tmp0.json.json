    "File Name": "vt-origin_13406__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file in question is classified as malicious and is associated with the Emotet malware family, which is prevalent for spreading banking trojans. The classification is strongly supported by numerous antivirus engines (61 engines) identifying it as malicious, along with specific naming of Emotet as the threat. Key indicators include abnormal modifications of registry settings and the deletion of \"Zone.Identifier\" ADS, suggesting attempts to bypass security checks. The Sigma analysis results and sandbox verdicts align with these findings, as they detect traits consistent with Trojan behavior, such as persistence methods. Overall, the file demonstrates behavior typical of Emotet, posing significant risks related to credential theft and network propagation."

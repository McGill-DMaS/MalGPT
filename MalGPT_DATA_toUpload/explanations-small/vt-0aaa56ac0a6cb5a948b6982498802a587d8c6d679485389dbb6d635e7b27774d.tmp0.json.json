    "File Name": "vt-0aaa56ac0a6cb5a948b6982498802a587d8c6d679485389dbb6d635e7b27774d.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file is classified as benign, primarily due to the absence of any detections from antivirus engines. All 68 engines used in the last analysis identified it as undetected, with none marking it as malicious or suspicious. The file is a signed DLL associated with Adobe Premiere Pro CS6, indicating it's likely to be legitimate software. Sandbox results show no harmful behavior, as categories such as persistence, encryption, or command-and-control communications were not observed. The revoked certificate tag may suggest caution, but without additional risk indicators or abnormal behavior, the file remains benign."

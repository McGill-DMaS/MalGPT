    "Explanation": "The file `libatomic-1.dll` is classified as benign, as none of the 69 antivirus engines detected it as malicious. The absence of malicious detections indicates a typical system or application library, with no indicators such as URLs, IPs, or domains associated with suspicious activity. No YARA rules or unique sandbox behaviors that suggest malicious intent were identified, and the analysis showed no ties to any MITRE ATT&CK tactics or techniques. Therefore, with a lack of any risky behaviors or red flags, the file appears safe for use."

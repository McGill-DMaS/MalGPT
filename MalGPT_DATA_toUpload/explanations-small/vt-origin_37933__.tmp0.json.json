Detection statistics reveal that over 50 antivirus engines have flagged it as malicious, with only a few engines not detecting it. Key indicators include signatures pointing to adware and trojan behaviors, such as \"Gen:Variant.Application.Bundler.Morstar.30\" and \"Downloader.Morstar.Win32\", alongside other suspicious results. No specific YARA rules or MITRE ATT&CK tactics were provided, but the abundance of malicious categorizations highlights significant risks, primarily involving potential downloading and installation of additional unwanted software."

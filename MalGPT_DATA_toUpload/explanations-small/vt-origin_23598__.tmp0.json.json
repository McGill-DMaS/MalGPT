    "Explanation": "The analyzed file is classified as malicious, primarily identified as a variant of the DownloadAdmin malware family. The detection statistics reveal that 60 antivirus engines flagged the file as malicious, underlining its threat potential. Key indicators include multiple detections of potentially unwanted programs (PUP) and adware, suggesting behaviors such as unwanted software bundling or intrusive advertising. Additionally, the file's signature verification failed because the certificate was not valid at the time of analysis, which is a common trait of suspicious or malicious files.

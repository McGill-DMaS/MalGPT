    "File Name": "vt-origin_28794__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file is classified as malicious, identified primarily as a member of the \"brmon\" and \"gandcrypt\" malware families, highlighting its functionality as a trojan and ransomware. This classification is supported by detections from 66 antivirus engines, including respected engines such as McAfee, Microsoft, and Kaspersky, which all flagged the file as potentially harmful due to its trojan and ransomware characteristics. Key indicators include features like network checks and direct CPU clock access, which can suggest persistence and surveillance capabilities. Sandbox analysis shows possible execution of persistence methods, long sleep cycles, and potential spreading functions. Furthermore, the file's ability to embed itself deeply within a system suggests tactics related to persistence as outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, reflecting risks like data encryption and unauthorized access."

    "File Name": "vt-origin_19034__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file is classified as malicious due to consistent detection by numerous antivirus engines, with 63 identifying it as such. The detections predominantly associate it with trojan-related families, including \"Trojan.Packed2.40557,\" \"Gen:Variant.Zusy.271862,\" and \"Trojan.Win32.Khalesi,\" which indicates its likely behavior in distributing trojans. There are no specific URLs, IPs, domains, YARA rules, or MITRE ATT&CK techniques mentioned in the report, suggesting a focus on signature-based detection. The high rate of detection and association with known malicious behaviors represent significant risks, including potential data exfiltration or further malware distribution."

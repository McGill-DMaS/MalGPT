    "Explanation": "The file is classified as benign. An analysis by multiple antivirus engines yielded predominantly undetected results, with 73 out of 75 engines indicating no detection, and only VBA32 suggesting a possibility of malicious behavior, categorized as \"BScope.Trojan.Bitrep.\" Sandbox verdicts from DAS-Security Orcas and Zenbox also returned clean results, indicating no harmful behavior during execution. There are no detected malicious URLs, IPs, or domains, reinforcing the benign classification. The thorough absence of harmful behavior or indications suggests that any singular detection might be a false positive."

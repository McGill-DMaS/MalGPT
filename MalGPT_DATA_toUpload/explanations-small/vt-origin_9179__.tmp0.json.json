    "File Name": "vt-origin_9179__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file is classified as malicious, primarily detected as an adware or potentially unwanted application under the 'DownloadAdmin' family by several antivirus engines. 47 out of the tested services flagged it as malicious, indicating high consistency in the detection. The file is associated with suspicious activities such as unwanted program downloads and modifications to system settings, evidenced by its interactions with Windows registry and file operations. The digital signatures are outdated, adding to the suspicion, as they do not provide trusted verification. While specific MITRE ATT&CK tactics or YARA rules are not listed, the prominent risk lies in its ability to install unwanted software and potentially alter system settings without user consent."

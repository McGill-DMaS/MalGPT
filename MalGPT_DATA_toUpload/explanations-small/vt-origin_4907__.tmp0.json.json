The high detection count indicates widespread recognition of the file\u2019s malicious nature. The file lacks unique indicators such as URLs or IPs, but its associations with common malware techniques, such as code sections with high entropy and imported functions indicative of potentially harmful behavior, reinforce its classification. No specific YARA rules, sandbox results, or MITRE ATT&CK mappings are mentioned in the report, but the detected behaviors suggest typical malware risks like data theft or network propagation."

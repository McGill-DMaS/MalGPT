    "File Name": "vt-origin_8920__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file is classified as malicious, detected by numerous antivirus engines citing categories like application-type threats and adware, with specific identifications such as W32.AIDetect.malware1 and PUA.Codetechno.Gen. The signed certificate is invalid due to it being outside the validity period, which raises concerns about the file's legitimacy. Many engines report it as a downloader and potentially unwanted program (PUP), indicating it may introduce unwanted software or affect system performance. The behavior suggests tactics like executing unauthorized downloads, aligning with MITRE ATT&CK techniques related to initial access and persistence, potentially posing a risk of additional malware payloads being delivered."

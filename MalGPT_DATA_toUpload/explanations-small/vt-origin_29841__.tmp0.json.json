    "File Name": "vt-origin_29841__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The analyzed file is classified as malicious primarily due to its association with the Emotet and QuackBot families, as identified by multiple antivirus engines. Detection statistics are overwhelmingly indicative of malware, with 58 engines labeling it as malicious. Notable indicators include various Trojan signatures and generic malware detections. YARA rules or specific signatures aren't mentioned, but its prominent categorization under known malware families suggests significant risk. There are no explicit references to sandbox results or MITRE ATT&CK tactics, although the file's structure and behavior suggest it might engage in activities common to these families, such as data exfiltration or spreading within networks."

    "File Name": "vt-origin_20316__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file in question is classified as malicious, primarily associated with the \"DownloadAdmin\" adware family. This classification is supported by consistent detections from 47 out of 62 antivirus engines, indicating the presence of adware and potentially unwanted programs (PUPs) such as 'Application.Generic' and 'Trojan.Win32.Generic'. Key indicators include its multiple submissions as an executable and the presence of outdated certificates, possibly facilitating malware persistence. Although YARA rules and MITRE ATT&CK tactics are not explicitly detailed, the prevalence of adware-related detections suggests the file's primary risk involves unwanted advertisements and potential data privacy concerns."

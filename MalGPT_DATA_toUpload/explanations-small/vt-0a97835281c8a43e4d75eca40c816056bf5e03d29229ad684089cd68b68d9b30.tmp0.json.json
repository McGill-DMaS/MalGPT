    "Explanation": "The file is classified as benign based on the analysis report. None of the 65 antivirus engines detected it as malicious or suspicious, and it is categorized as undetected by all engines. The file appears to be a legitimate Microsoft ASP.NET Core DLL with valid signatures from Microsoft, although some of the certificates are not currently time-valid. There are no suspicious indicators such as URLs, IPs, or domains associated with it, nor are there any noted behaviors such as persistence or encryption that would indicate malicious activity. The absence of evidence pointing to harmful behavior supports the benign classification."

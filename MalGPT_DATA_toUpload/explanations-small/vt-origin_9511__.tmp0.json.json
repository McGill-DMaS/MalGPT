    "File Name": "vt-origin_9511__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file is classified as malicious, predominantly identified as a member of the Trojan family, specifically linked to Emotet and other variants like Trojan.Mint.Zamg.Q. This classification is supported by 53 antivirus engines flagging it as malicious, with no detections of it being benign. Many engines identified characteristics of Trojan-like behavior, such as obfuscation and distribution methods. There are no specific URLs, IPs, or domains publicly known from this analysis, and sandbox behavior details are absent. Despite lacking detailed behavior analysis, the combination of multiple detections and the naming of known malware families indicate significant risks associated with this file, such as potential data theft and network propagation."

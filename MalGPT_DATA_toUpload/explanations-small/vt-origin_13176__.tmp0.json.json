    "File Name": "vt-origin_13176__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file in question is classified as malicious, predominantly identified as a Trojan with ties to families such as Trojan.MSILPerseus and Androm. It is reported as malicious by 58 antivirus engines, including prominent names like BitDefender, McAfee, and Microsoft. This detection commonly points towards behaviors linked with Trojans, which can include unauthorized access or control over the host system. Key indicators that support this classification include the detection of a potentially unwanted application (PUA) by Microsoft and a high reputation risk score. Furthermore, the invalid signature indicates a lack of verified provenance, common in fraudulent software. These factors combined indicate a high risk of system infiltration and potential data compromise."

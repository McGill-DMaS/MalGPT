    "File Name": "vt-origin_36938__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file is classified as malicious, predominantly associated with adware and potentially unwanted programs (PUPs), as evidenced by multiple antivirus engines, including F-Secure, Kaspersky, and Avast labeling it malicious due to adware characteristics like downloading administration-related risks. Key indicators include a non-time-valid code-signing certificate issued by \"Code Techno,\" indicative of possible tampering or misuse. While no specific URLs or C2 communications are noted, the presence of adware markers suggests risks of unwanted behavior such as displaying unsolicited ads or modifying browser settings. There are no specific sandbox results or MITRE ATT&CK techniques detailed, but general adware risks include possible persistence mechanisms and interference in user experience."

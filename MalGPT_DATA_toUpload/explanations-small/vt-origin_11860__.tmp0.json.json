    "File Name": "vt-origin_11860__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The analyzed file is classified as malicious, primarily identified as part of the Kryptik and Androm malware families. This conclusion is supported by detection from 54 antivirus engines, which flagged it as malicious due to specific patterns like Gen:Variant.MSILKrypt.72 and Backdoor.Win32.Androm variants. The presence of tags such as \"direct-cpu-clock-access\" and \"detect-debug-environment\" further indicates suspicious behavior associated with malware. No specific URLs, IPs, or domains were reported, and there are no sandbox results or MITRE ATT&CK tactics explicitly mentioned. The file\u2019s primary risk lies in its potential for backdoor access and data theft."

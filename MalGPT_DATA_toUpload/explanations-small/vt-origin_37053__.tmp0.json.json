    "File Name": "vt-origin_37053__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file is classified as malicious due to positive detections from numerous antivirus engines, with over 60 engines flagging it as harmful. It is associated with the \"DownloadAdmin\" family and shows characteristics often seen in potentially unwanted applications (PUAs) and adware, as indicated by several engines labeling it as such. The expired digital certificate further raises suspicion, suggesting illegitimacy or tampering. Despite being a Windows PE executable, the lack of valid certification, combined with its high detection rate and suspicious classification by reputable security engines, corroborates its malicious intent. No specific URLs, IPs, or sandbox behaviors were provided, nor YARA rules or MITRE ATT&CK tactics, which might give deeper insights into its malicious activities."

    "File Name": "vt-origin_26713__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file is classified as malicious, primarily identified as belonging to the \"Adware\" family and specifically flagged by several antivirus engines with designations like \"DownloadAdmin\" and \"Trojan.\" It was detected as malicious by 50 engines, confirming its potential threat. Key indicators contributing to its classification involve its capability to act as an adware or downloader, suggesting the presence of potentially unwanted programs (PUPs) and trojans. The presence of several import functions from well-known DLLs such as SHELL32 and ADVAPI32, including suspicious signatures and expired certificates, further indicate that the file is likely designed to perform undesirable actions on a system. No related YARA rules or specific sandbox results such as persistence or encryption attempts are discussed, but the file exhibits characteristics typical of software trying to bypass user consent and deliver unwanted payloads."

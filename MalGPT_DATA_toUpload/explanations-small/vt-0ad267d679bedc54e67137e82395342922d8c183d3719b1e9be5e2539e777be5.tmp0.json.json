    "Explanation": "The file in question is classified as benign. This conclusion is supported by detection statistics, where all antivirus engines that scanned the file reported it as undetected or harmless. Sandbox verdicts also categorize it as clean, reinforcing its non-malicious nature. While the file is signed and associated with Tencent Technology (a known entity), several certificates in the signature chain are not time valid, though this does not necessarily indicate malicious behavior. Overall, no indicators such as suspicious URLs, IPs, or YARA rule matches are present, further supporting the benign classification."

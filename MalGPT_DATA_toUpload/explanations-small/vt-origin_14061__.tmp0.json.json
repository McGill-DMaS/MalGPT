    "File Name": "vt-origin_14061__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file is classified as malicious, primarily attributed to its identification with the Solimba adware family, as detected by multiple security engines such as Kaspersky, BitDefender, and AVG, which recognize it as a potentially unwanted application (PUA). With 47 out of 67 antivirus engines flagging it as malicious, the significant detection reinforces its harmful classification. Key indicators include its distribution via the Tor network and being digitally signed, albeit with an outdated and potentially compromised signature chain. The file exhibits typical adware behavior with potential for unwanted software bundling, downloading, or installation, posing significant privacy and security risks."

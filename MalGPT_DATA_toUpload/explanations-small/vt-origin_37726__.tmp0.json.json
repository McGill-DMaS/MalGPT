    "File Name": "vt-origin_37726__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file is classified as malicious, primarily due to its identification by numerous antivirus engines (47 detections) as associated with various malware families such as adware, potentially unwanted applications (PUA), and Trojan downloaders. It has been flagged with specific results like \"Application.Bundler.KJ\" and \"PUA.DownloadAdmin,\" which indicate that it may bundle additional unwanted software and perform unauthorized activities. The signature verification failure, coupled with its high detection rate, further raises suspicion about its intent and potential risks. No specific YARA rules, MITRE ATT&CK tactics, or sandbox activities are mentioned, but the collective antivirus detections suggest a high-risk profile."

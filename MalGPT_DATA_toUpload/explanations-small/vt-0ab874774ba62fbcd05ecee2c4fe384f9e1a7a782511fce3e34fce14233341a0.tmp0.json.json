This determination is supported by the fact that 70 antivirus engines examined it and found it undetected, with zero engines marking it as malicious or suspicious. The file is a Microsoft Visual C++ DLL, identified specifically as a part of LEADTOOLS\u00ae, and its legitimate nature is reinforced by the absence of any malicious indicators such as suspicious URLs, IPs, or YARA rule matches. Sandbox analysis did not report any related malicious activities such as persistence or communications with a command-and-control server. Additionally, no techniques associated with MITRE ATT&CK were triggered during the analysis."

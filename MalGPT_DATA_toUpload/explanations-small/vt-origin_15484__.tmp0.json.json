    "Explanation": "The file is classified as malicious based on detections from 56 antivirus engines, with labels such as \"Trojan.BRMon.Gen.1\" and \"Trojan.Win32.Generic.\" The high detection rate strongly indicates a trojan family of malware. Notable antivirus engines like Microsoft and Kaspersky also flag the file as malicious, suggesting its association with various Trojan and generic malware signatures. There are no specific domain or IP indicators listed in the report, nor are there details about sandbox behaviors like persistence or communication with a command and control server. Additionally, no YARA rules or MITRE ATT&CK tactics are mentioned, but the consensus from multiple security vendors highlights significant risks of compromise if the file is executed."

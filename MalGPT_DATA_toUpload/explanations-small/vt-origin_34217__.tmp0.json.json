    "File Name": "vt-origin_34217__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file analyzed is classified as malicious due to its detection by numerous antivirus engines, including those from Bkav, FireEye, and Symantec, indicating potential threats such as Trojan or Adware. Many engines identify it within the Application.Bundler or Downloader.Win32 families, suggesting it may package unwanted applications or download harmful software. The invalid and expired code signing certificates further raise suspicion about its trustworthiness. Overall, the combination of high confidence detections and invalid certificates is a substantial indicator of whether the file could exhibit risky behaviors like unauthorized downloads and bundling potentially unwanted applications."

Additionally, sandbox analysis results classify it as harmless, with no malware-related activities detected. The file's association with a legitimate software product, Windows Live\u00ae Photo Gallery, further supports its benign nature, and there is no evidence of malicious network behavior or tactics consistent with MITRE ATT&CK techniques."

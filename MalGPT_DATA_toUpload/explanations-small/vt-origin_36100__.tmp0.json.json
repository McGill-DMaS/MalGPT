    "File Name": "vt-origin_36100__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file is classified as malicious, predominantly identified as part of the Emotet malware family. This classification is supported by detection from 59 antivirus engines that flagged the file as malicious, including recognitions as Trojan variants and behavior similar to Emotet. Key indicators suggest it may exhibit typical Trojan behaviors such as unauthorized data access and potential for deployment of additional payloads. No specific YARA rules, URLs, or IPs were noted, but the strong consensus among multiple engines highlights significant risk of espionage and data compromise typical of Emotet variants. There is no specific mention of MITRE ATT&CK tactics, but associated techniques might involve credential theft and lateral movement within networks."

    "File Name": "vt-origin_11081__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file is classified as malicious, primarily identified as being associated with the \"DownloadAdmin\" and \"Adware\" families. Detection statistics are significant, with 49 antivirus engines marking it as malicious, indicating a high confidence in its malicious nature. Key indicators include its classification as potentially unwanted software (PUA) and adware, common in files that might download additional unwanted programs. While no specific URLs, IPs, or domains are listed, the presence of multiple adware signatures and the involvement in common ad distribution tactics suggest it may perform operations such as downloading additional unwanted components. There is no detailed information on YARA rules, sandbox results, or MITRE ATT&CK tactics in the report; however, given the detections, it poses risks of advertising-related actions and potential privacy concerns for users."

    "File Name": "vt-origin_25431__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file is classified as malicious due to multiple antivirus engines, including McAfee, Malwarebytes, and Kaspersky, detecting it as harmful, notably identifying it with families like Fareit, PonyStealer, and Trojan. The sandbox verdicts from Dr.Web vxCube and Lastline also confirm its malicious nature, citing behaviors typical of Trojans and credential-stealing malware. The presence of a high reputation score indicates suspicious activity, further supported by key indicators like unusual runtime modules and characteristics such as direct CPU clock access and long sleeps. These behaviors suggest the file may attempt persistence, data exfiltration, or interaction with command-and-control servers, aligning with known attack patterns under the MITRE ATT&CK framework."

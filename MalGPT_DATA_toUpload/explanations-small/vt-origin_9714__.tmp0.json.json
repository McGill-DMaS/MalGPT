    "File Name": "vt-origin_9714__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file has been classified as malicious by numerous antivirus engines, with 45 engines marking it as malicious, indicating a high confidence in its classification as a threat. It is associated with the \"Morstar\" adware family and similar PUP (Potentially Unwanted Program) categories like \"Firseria\" and \"Solimba.\" These detections signal behaviors typically linked to adware or bundler software, which might be risky for user privacy and system integrity. The comprehensive identification by various engines across different vendors suggests that the file potentially exhibits multiple warning behaviors such as downloading additional components, intrusive advertisements, or unwanted software installations. However, the absence of specific behavioral patterns, sandbox analysis, or MITRE ATT&CK mappings in the report limits further concrete assertions about its operational tactics."

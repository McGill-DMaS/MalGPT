    "Explanation": "The file is classified as malicious based on the detection by Sunbelt as \"Trojan-Spy.Win32.FtpSend.A (vf),\" indicative of a potential spyware threat. Among 38 antivirus engines, only Sunbelt flagged the file as malicious, while the rest categorized it as undetected, suggesting low overall detection. The lack of additional signs such as suspicious URLs, IPs, or domains, and the absence of explicit behavior analysis or YARA rules, limits understanding of the file's actions and capabilities. There are no further details on MITRE ATT&CK techniques or noted suspicious behaviors from sandbox testing, which leaves specific risks largely undefined."

    "File Name": "vt-origin_577__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file in the report is classified as malicious based on significant detection by multiple antivirus engines, identifying it as part of the \"DownloadAdmin\" family, a known adware and potentially unwanted program. It was detected by 48 out of 67 engines, confirming the presence of various adware signatures, such as \"W32.HfsAdware\" and \"SoftwareBundler:Win32/Dowadmin.\" The absence of sandbox behavior, YARA rules, or MITRE ATT&CK tactics in the report suggests reliance on known signature detection rather than behavioral analysis. The file carries risks associated with adware, including unwanted software installations and potential privacy concerns."

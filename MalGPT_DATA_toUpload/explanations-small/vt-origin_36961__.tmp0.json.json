    "File Name": "vt-origin_36961__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file in question is classified as malicious by multiple antivirus engines, with 62 engines identifying it as such. It belongs to the malware family often associated with \"DownloadAdmin\" and \"PUA\" (Potentially Unwanted Applications) behaviors, suggesting it may be adware or a downloader. Despite being signed, the certificate is no longer valid, reducing its trustworthiness. Key indicators of its malicious nature include the use of multiple libraries related to system manipulation (e.g., KERNEL32, SHELL32) and suspicious imports such as `CreateProcessA` and `ShellExecuteA`. There are no specific sandbox analysis results or MITRE ATT&CK tactics detailed, but its classification as a downloader indicates potential risks, such as unwanted software installation or system slowdown."

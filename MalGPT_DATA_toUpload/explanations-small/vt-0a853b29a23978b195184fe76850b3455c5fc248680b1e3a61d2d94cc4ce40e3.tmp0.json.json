    "Explanation": "The file in question, \"MTVS8CDSP.dll,\" is classified as benign based on the analysis. This determination is primarily due to the lack of detections across all antivirus engines, with no engines marking it as malicious or suspicious out of the 70 that scanned it. Although the signature of the file is deemed invalid due to time-related issues with the certificates, it is signed by a legitimate company, \"\u53a6\u95e8\u7f8e\u56fe\u7f51\u79d1\u6280\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8,\" which implies authenticity. There are no behavioral traits or sandbox results suggesting malicious activities such as persistence, encryption, or command-and-control communication. The file shows an extensive import list typical for benign software, further supporting its innocuous nature in this context."

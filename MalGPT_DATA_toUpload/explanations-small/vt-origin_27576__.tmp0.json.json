    "File Name": "vt-origin_27576__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file in question is classified as malicious and associated with the \"DownloadAdmin\" malware family, primarily identified as adware or potentially unwanted program (PUP). The detection statistics show that 51 antivirus engines flagged the file as malicious, with no engines classifying it as harmless. A key indicator is the invalidity of the certificate, as it's not within its validity period, hinting at a possible evasion technique. No specific URLs, IPs, domains, or YARA rules are mentioned, and there are no sandbox results or MITRE ATT&CK techniques provided. Overall, the main risk is the unwanted program's potential to download additional harmful software."

    "File Name": "vt-origin_13301__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file is classified as malicious, primarily belonging to the Emotet malware family, which is a notorious Trojan known for its capability to steal sensitive information and facilitate other threats. A significant number of antivirus engines (62 out of 73) have flagged it as malicious, with some specifically identifying it as Emotet. This classification is supported by various detections of Trojan behaviors, including actions that suggest persistence and potential unauthorized access to system resources. Additionally, the presence of imported functions from critical system libraries further indicates potential harmful operations related to network and system manipulation. There is no specific mention of YARA rules, sandbox results, or MITRE ATT&CK techniques directly tied in the report, but the high detection rate corroborates the malicious classification."

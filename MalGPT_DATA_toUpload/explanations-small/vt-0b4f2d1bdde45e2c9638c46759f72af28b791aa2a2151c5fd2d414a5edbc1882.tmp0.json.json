    "Explanation": "The file \"KSound.dll\" is classified as benign based on the analysis report. This determination is supported by the fact that 71 antivirus engines detected it as undetected, and none flagged it as malicious or suspicious. While the file has an invalid signature and revoked certificate, these issues alone are not indicative of malicious activity. No suspicious behaviors, URLs, or IP addresses were identified, and there are no YARA rules or sandbox results suggesting malicious behavior. The file lacks traits associated with malware, such as MITRE ATT&CK techniques or persistence capabilities, reinforcing its benign status."

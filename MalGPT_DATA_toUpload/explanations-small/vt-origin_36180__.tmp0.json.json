    "File Name": "vt-origin_36180__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file is classified as malicious, specifically associated with the Emotet malware family. The majority of antivirus engines identified the file as a threat, labeling it as a trojan, with several engines specifically naming Emotet. Key indicators include suspicious network traffic to an IP address distinct from expected legitimate sources, and YARA rules that detect known Emotet patterns. Sandbox analysis corroborates its malicious characteristics, classifying it as a trojan with evasion tactics. The primary risk is the file's ability to execute payloads typical of Emotet, potentially jeopardizing system security by spreading malware and facilitating data exfiltration."

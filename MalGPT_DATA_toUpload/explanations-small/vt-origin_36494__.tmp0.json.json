    "Explanation": "The file is classified as malicious, with 47 out of 66 antivirus engines detecting it as such, indicating a strong consensus across multiple platforms.

Indicators for this classification include behaviors consistent with adware influence, such as downloading additional software without user consent. No specific MITRE ATT&CK techniques or sandbox results are detailed in the report, but the file's association with adware suggests risks related to unwanted software installation and potential privacy issues."

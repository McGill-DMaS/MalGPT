    "Explanation": "This file is classified as benign, as it is a signed DLL associated with Microsoft SQL Server, indicating its legitimate origin. All 71 antivirus engines tested it and found no malicious indicators, as evidenced by the \"undetected\" status across the board. The signing certificates are from trusted authorities like Microsoft, although some certificates in the chain are not time-valid, which does not necessarily indicate a threat. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as persistence mechanisms, encryption activity, or command-and-control communications, reinforcing its benign classification."

    "File Name": "vt-origin_21743__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file analyzed is classified as malicious, primarily identified as a variant of adware or potentially unwanted application (PUA), related to the \"DownloadAdmin\" family. This classification is supported by detection from 61 antivirus engines, including reputable names like Symantec, Microsoft, and Kaspersky, indicating a consensus on its malicious nature. The file's certificate is not time-valid, which raises suspicion. Additionally, there are no specific YARA rules or IPs associated, but the general risk involves unwanted software bundling practices that can lead to further system compromise. No significant MITRE ATT&CK tactics or sandbox features such as encryption or command-and-control communication were directly noted, focusing the concern mainly on the file's potential to facilitate unwanted activities on the system."

    "Explanation": "The file in question is classified as benign based on the report. It is identified as a Microsoft SQL Server DLL, which aligns with known legitimate distribution from Microsoft, supported by NSRL entries. Detection statistics from antivirus engines show zero detections across 69 engines, with most categorizing the file as undetected or harmless. There are no suspicious URLs, IPs, domains, YARA rules, or other signatures associated with the file. Sandbox analyses also report the file as harmless with no malicious behavior such as persistence, encryption, or command-and-control (C2) activities. There are no relevant MITRE ATT&CK tactics or techniques associated. In summary, the lack of detection across multiple security measures and its legitimate origin supports its classification as benign."

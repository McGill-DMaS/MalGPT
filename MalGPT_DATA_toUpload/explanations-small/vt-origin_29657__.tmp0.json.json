    "Explanation": "The file in question is classified as malicious, predominantly identified as belonging to the Morstar family, a known bundler with potential adware functionalities. Detection statistics indicate malicious properties were found by 58 antivirus engines, while 13 engines did not detect it, showing high consensus on its malicious nature. Many engines classify it as a potentially unwanted program (PUP) or adware, highlighting concerns about unwanted application behavior and potential for trojan-like activity, such as TrojanDropper and Riskware identified by some engines. No specific YARA rules, URLs, IPs, or domains were reported, nor are there sandbox results summarizing its behavior, like encryption or C2 communications, and no MITRE ATT&CK tactics or techniques were directly matched. The main risk lies in its potential for unwanted software bundling, privacy invasion, and the installation of additional unwanted software."

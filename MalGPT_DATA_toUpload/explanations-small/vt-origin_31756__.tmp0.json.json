    "File Name": "vt-origin_31756__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file is classified as malicious and part of the Emotet trojan family. Detection statistics show that 62 antivirus engines flagged it as malicious, indicating high confidence in its threat potential. Notable indicators include the file's categorization as a trojan and specific identification as Emotet, a known banking trojan, which often spreads through phishing emails. The presence of suspicious sections and a range of imported functions across various libraries further suggests malware capabilities. No specific sandbox results, YARA rules, or MITRE ATT&CK techniques were detailed in the report, but the detection by numerous engines points to typical Emotet-like behavior such as persistence, spreading, and potential data theft."

    "File Name": "vt-origin_32295__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file in question is classified as malicious, predominantly identified as adware and potentially unwanted application (PUA) by numerous antivirus engines including Bkav, Symantec, and Microsoft, with 49 detections labeling it malicious. The file's detection as \"DownloadAdmin\" or a \"Downloader\" points to behavior consistent with downloading and possibly executing unwanted software. Its digital certificate is not valid, with signers like Code Techno, which raises further suspicions. Additionally, its classification under different malware families and behaviors like riskware indicate a high-risk potential for users. There is no specific MITRE ATT&CK tactic or technique referenced, but the presence of risky behaviors such as downloading components suggests malicious intent."

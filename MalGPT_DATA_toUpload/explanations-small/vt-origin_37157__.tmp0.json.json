    "File Name": "vt-origin_37157__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file in the report is classified as malicious, identified predominantly within the DownloadAdmin adware or PUA (Potentially Unwanted Application) family. This conclusion is based on detection by 50 antivirus engines marking it as malicious, including well-known names like McAfee, Kaspersky, and Microsoft. A critical indicator is its invalid digital signature, which suggests that it was not time-valid or has expired, raising suspicions about its authenticity. No specific MITRE ATT&CK tactics or techniques are explicitly mentioned, nor are any advanced features such as encryption or Command and Control (C2) activities detailed. The main risk posed by this file is its adware behavior, potentially leading to unwanted installations or downloads."

    "Explanation": "This file is classified as malicious, likely belonging to the Trojan family, specifically associated with CXZY and Fareit variants. The classification is supported by detection from 60 antivirus engines, identifying it as a threat, with many labeling it as a generic Trojan or specifically linking it to Trojan types such as Agent, Injector, or LokiBot. A YARA rule triggered for UPX, indicating the file is UPX-compressed, further suggests obfuscation techniques commonly used in malware. Sandbox analysis and other behavioral indicators are not specified, but the high rate of detection and threat labels signify potential risks of data theft or unauthorized access to systems."

This conclusion is supported by the comprehensive analysis showing that none of the 68 antivirus engines flagged the file as malicious or suspicious, with all results categorized as undetected. The file matches the characteristics of a legitimate Microsoft Windows DLL (mpssvc.dll), with details such as the product being identified as 'Microsoft\u00ae Windows\u00ae Operating System' and a file description of 'Microsoft Protection Service'. There are no indications of URLs, IPs, or domains, nor are there any notable behaviors or risks associated with the file, such as persistence or encryption attempts. The absence of any detected threat activities aligns with no found MITRE ATT&CK tactics or techniques."

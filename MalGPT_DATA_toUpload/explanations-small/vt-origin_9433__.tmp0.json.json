    "File Name": "vt-origin_9433__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The analyzed file is classified as malicious, predominantly associated with the Solimba and Firseria families. Over 60 antivirus engines detected it as malicious, identifying characteristics such as being a downloader and bundler, suggesting potential adware or PUA (Potentially Unwanted Application) behavior. The file's classification is reinforced by the presence of multiple code-signing certificates, some of which are outdated, potentially contributing to its deceptive characteristics. While specific URLs, IPs, or behavioral indicators like persistence or command-and-control (C2) were not detailed, the collective detection results highlight the file's risk of distributing unwanted software."

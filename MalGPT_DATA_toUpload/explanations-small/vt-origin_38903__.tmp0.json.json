    "File Name": "vt-origin_38903__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file is classified as malicious, primarily due to being detected by numerous antivirus engines as related to the GandCrab ransomware and Emotet trojan families. Detection statistics show 60 engines marking it as malicious, while none found it harmless. Key indicators such as the use of common trojan downloader techniques and ransomware characteristics, including obfuscation and persistence mechanisms, reinforce its classification. Sandbox results may suggest attempts at encryption and potential communication with command-and-control servers, typical of such malware. This file poses a high risk due to its capacity for data encryption, information theft, and system manipulation."

    "File Name": "vt-origin_40306__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file is classified as malicious, primarily belonging to the Emotet trojan family, as indicated by several antivirus engines like McAfee, Symantec, and Microsoft. Detection statistics show that 58 engines marked it as malicious, and none deemed it harmless. It exhibits key behaviors associated with trojans, such as the capability to execute potentially harmful activities observed in sandbox environments, which may include persistence and command-and-control (C2) communication. No specific MITRE ATT&CK tactics or techniques are outlined, but this classification suggests potential for data theft or disruption. The strong consensus among detection engines and the negative reputation score reinforce its malicious nature."

It is identified as a Lotus Domino Export Destination DLL for Crystal Reports, with a verified signature from SAP AG, despite some certificates in its chain being no longer valid. This DLL has been submitted twice but shows no suspicious behavior or association with known malware families. Additionally, there are no YARA rules or explicit indicators of compromise such as URLs, IPs, or domains linked to malicious activity, supporting its classification as benign."

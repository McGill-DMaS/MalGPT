    "File Name": "vt-0c09833c1e9569bfe60c423ec1682ddb939ecabb2e2855a67a6ca3c0c4b6d7e5.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file in question is classified as potentially malicious. While the majority of antivirus engines have marked it as undetected, two engines, APEX and Zillya, have flagged it as malicious and identified it as a \"Trojan.GofotCRTD.Win32.9506\". No specific YARA rules or MITRE ATT&CK tactics are mentioned to further classify the behavior, and there is a lack of specific URLs, IPs, or domains linked to malicious activities. The file is a Windows DLL, originally associated with \"splayers.dll\" and appears to be signed by \"Beijing Baofeng Inc.\" with an expired certificate, which could be indicative of suspicious activity. Despite these findings, the sandbox verdict categorized it as harmless, highlighting a discrepancy that needs expert investigation."

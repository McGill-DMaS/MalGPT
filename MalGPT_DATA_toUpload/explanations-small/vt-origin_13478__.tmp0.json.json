    "File Name": "vt-origin_13478__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file is classified as malicious based on multiple antivirus detections indicating it belongs to malware families such as Trojan.Androm and Loki ransomware. Detection statistics show that 61 antivirus engines marked it as malicious, with no engines detecting it as benign. The key indicators include usage of Visual Basic 6.0, execution within a Windows environment, and tags such as \"spreader\" and \"runtime-modules,\" which suggest it spreads and executes runtime modules. The absence of detailed sandbox results or specific MITRE ATT&CK tactics doesn't undermine its detection due to strong consensus among AVs. Overall, the file exhibits risky behavior consistent with known malware threats, including persistence and data-stealing potential."

    "Explanation": "The analyzed file, labeled as *Microsoft.TeamFoundation.Deployment.Workflow.dll*, is deemed benign. This classification is supported by the fact that none of the 71 antivirus engines detected malicious activity. Key indicators such as suspicious URLs or domains are absent, and the file is verified as signed by Microsoft Corporation, enhancing its credibility. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, such as data encryption or contact with a command and control server. No YARA rules matched, and no suspicious actions were identified in sandbox environments, suggesting no ties to known MITRE ATT&CK tactics or techniques."

    "File Name": "vt-origin_9052__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file in question is classified as malicious, primarily detected as adware and potentially unwanted software. A majority of antivirus engines (47 out of 63) flagged it as malicious, with detections labeling it as adware and various downloader applications (e.g., \"W32.HfsAdware.DD11\" by Bkav and \"Trojan.Gen.2\" by Symantec). The digital signature appears to be invalid, a common trait in malicious files to conceal harmful intent. This file poses risks potentially including unwanted installations, intrusive advertisements, and downloading further unwanted or harmful programs. There are no specific URLs, IPs, domains, YARA rules, sandbox activity, or MITRE ATT&CK techniques noted in this evaluation."

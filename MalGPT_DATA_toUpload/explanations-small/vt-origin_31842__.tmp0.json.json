    "File Name": "vt-origin_31842__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file is classified as malicious, with multiple antivirus engines (45 out of 70) detecting it as a threat. It's primarily identified as part of the Androm family, with detections indicating it is likely a Trojan or malware, such as \"Trojan.NSIS.Androm.6\" and \"Trojan.Win32.Injector.\" Key characteristics, such as its identification as a Windows PE executable using the Nullsoft Installer System (NSIS), and the presence of suspicious imports from common Windows libraries, contribute to its classification. Indicators of persistent or malicious behaviors, such as creating or modifying files and registry keys, were observed, consistent with activity detected in sandbox environments. Overall, the comprehensive detection across multiple platforms and the presence of known malicious signatures emphasize the file's risk."

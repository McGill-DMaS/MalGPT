    "File Name": "vt-origin_19052__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file is classified as malicious and associated with the Solimba adware family, primarily due to multiple antivirus engines detecting it as a potentially unwanted application (PUA) or adware. Over 50 antivirus vendors flagged the file as malicious, including well-known names like Symantec and Microsoft, identifying it with results such as \"Trojan.Gen\" and \"TrojanDropper:Win32/Sventore.C.\" Indicators like the presence of bundler-morstar variants suggest it may be involved in delivering unwanted software packages. The file's digital signature is flagged as invalid due to a time validity issue, adding suspicion. No specific URLs, IPs, or MITRE ATT&CK techniques were mentioned in the report, but the detection history strongly indicates its use in unwanted adware installations."

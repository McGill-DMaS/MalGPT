    "File Name": "vt-origin_13364__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file in question is classified as malicious, primarily due to the high number of detection alerts from antivirus engines, with 50 engines marking it as malicious. It is associated with multiple malware families, including \"Backdoor.Win32.Androm\" and \"Trojan.Win32.Generic,\" as indicated by many reputable antivirus tools. A key indicator includes a YARA rule detecting an XORed URL embedded within the executable, which suggests potential network communication capabilities often used for C2 activities. Additionally, the presence of packing with tools like \"Enigma\" and \"BobSoft\" provides further evidence of malicious intent as these techniques can be used to obfuscate and evade detection. The combination of these factors highlights the file's risks, which likely include unauthorized remote access and data exfiltration."

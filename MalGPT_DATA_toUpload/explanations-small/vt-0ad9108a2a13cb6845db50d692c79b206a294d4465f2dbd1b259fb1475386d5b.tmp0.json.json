Although the certificate is revoked and not time-valid, these issues do not inherently indicate malware. VirusTotal analysis shows that 68 antivirus engines did not detect any malicious behavior, with only one labeling it ambiguously as malicious under \"SigCompromised.AdobeSystemsIncorporated.\" Furthermore, sandbox results categorize this file as harmless with no threatening behavior like persistence or unauthorized connection attempts reported. There are no noteworthy indicators like suspicious URLs or IPs, and no specific behaviors are linked to known MITRE ATT&CK techniques."

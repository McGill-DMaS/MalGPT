    "File Name": "vt-origin_6440__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file is classified as malicious due to its association with the Emotet malware family, as indicated by multiple antivirus engines detecting it as a Trojan, with specific mentions of Emotet and Dovs. A significant number of engines, 63 out of the total analyzed, flagged it as malicious, displaying high confidence in its harmful nature. There are no specific URL, IP addresses, or domains mentioned, but typical Emotet behavior includes persistence mechanisms and network communication may be involved, although not explicitly stated here. There is no direct mention of YARA rules or sandbox analyses, but the involvement of runtime modules and behaviors such as long sleeps suggest attempts to avoid detection and analysis. Overall, the file poses significant risks of spreading, data exfiltration, and system compromise."

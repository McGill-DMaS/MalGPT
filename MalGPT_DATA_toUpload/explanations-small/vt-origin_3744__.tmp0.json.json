    "File Name": "vt-origin_3744__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file is classified as malicious, belonging to several malware and potentially unwanted application (PUA) families such as Adware, Trojan, and Downloader. The report indicates that 61 antivirus engines flagged the file as malicious with multiple labels like \"W32.AIDetect.malware1,\" \"Trojan.Gen.2,\" and \"PUA.Codetechno.Gen,\" showing a high level of confidence in the detection. The file has a bad reputation primarily due to being associated with certain risk-ware behaviors like unwanted software bundling and adware activities. Despite being signed, the digital certificate validation failed due to the certificate not being valid within the current system clock or signed file's timestamp. This combination of factors underscores the malicious nature of the file, emphasizing the need for caution."

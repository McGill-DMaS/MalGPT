    "Explanation": "The file is classified as benign, attributed to its identification as a trusted and legitimate DLL from a known distributor, Microsoft Corporation, explicitly marked as \"goodware\" by Microsoft. None of the antivirus engines listed in the report detect this file as malicious, showing 0 entries for both malicious and suspicious categories, further indicating that the file poses no risk or harmful behavior. The file's attributes, such as being a Win32 DLL with legitimate tags like 'trusted' and 'known-distributor,' support this benign classification. The lack of any indicators of compromise such as malicious URLs, IPs, or domains, alongside the absence of any suspicious activity in the sandbox, corroborates the file's harmless nature."

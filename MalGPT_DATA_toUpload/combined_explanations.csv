A total of 51 engines identified it as malicious, emphasizing its nature as a threat capable of downloading and potentially executing other malicious payloads, often without user consent. The presence of multiple certificates, some invalid, points to its attempts to disguise its legitimacy.

Key behaviors of the malware include persistence via registry manipulation (as observed with functions like `RegSetValueExA` and `RegQueryValueExA`), potential file and process manipulation, and possibly droppers for additional malicious software. This aligns with tactics from the MITRE ATT&CK framework, such as ""Execution"" and ""Persistence"". No specific IOCs such as URLs or IPs were identified from this analysis, nor were any YARA rules noted. Countermeasures include applying strict software download policies, deploying reputable antivirus solutions with real-time protection, and educating users on risks related to software bundlers. Possible mitigation strategies include isolating the affected systems, auditing network traffic for unusual activity, and conducting a thorough cleanup of the system including registry entries and temporary files. Adopting a least privilege access model and frequently updating software will further help contain and mitigate such threats."
origin_14537__.tmp0.json.json,"The file identified as ""TASXAF2P.exe"" belongs to a malware family associated with bundlers, specifically the Morstar and Solimba variants. This file exhibits several traits typical of potentially unwanted programs (PUPs), such as adware and trojan behaviors, which are persistent across numerous antivirus engines, including Kaspersky, BitDefender, and Microsoft. With a total of 48 detections classifying it as malicious, the primary patterns reveal its functioning as an application bundler or downloader designed to drop additional threats or unwanted software onto the victim's system. Its reputation among security engines underscores its malicious potential, further evidenced by its classification as a downloader for adware and other PUPs.

Given the file's potential for harm, several countermeasures and mitigations are recommended. Users should employ updated antivirus solutions to detect and neutralize such threats proactively. Additionally, behavioral monitoring through endpoint protection platforms can mitigate risk by flagging unusual system behaviors associated with this malware family. Users should also ensure their operating systems and all software are current with the latest security patches, limiting exploit opportunities. Organizations can enhance defenses by employing network-based controls to prevent communication with potential command and control (C2) servers often associated with downloading additional payloads."
origin_14554__.tmp0.json.json,"The analyzed file is classified as malicious, primarily identified as a member of the Solimba adware family. This classification can be inferred from consistent detections across multiple antivirus engines, including ESET-NOD32, which identifies it as a variant of MSIL/Solimba.AK.gen, and Kaspersky, labeling it as not-a-virus:AdWare.Win32.Solimba.bk. Notable detections also include names such as Morstar (by BitDefender and F-Prot) and Firseria (by Tencent and Comodo). A substantial number of 49 antivirus engines flagged the file as malicious indicating a high confidence level in this determination. This malware exhibits features typical of adware, including potential unwanted behavior, which often leads to intrusive ads or bundled applications on Windows systems.

No specific Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) such as domains, IPs, or URLs are mentioned, and there are no reports of sandbox analysis results relating to tactics like persistence, encryption usage, or command and control (C2) server communication. The file is signed by Imbernes Premium s.l., but this signature is either invalid or expired, highlighting a potential trust issue in the execution. For mitigation, users are advised to employ updated antivirus solutions to prevent download or execution of such files. Moreover, practicing caution while downloading software, particularly from unverified sources, can help reduce the risk of exposure to adware. Monitoring network traffic for any unusual activities might assist in early detection of such infections."
origin_14562__.tmp0.json.json,"The analyzed file appears to belong to the ""Adware.Downware"" or ""DownloadAdmin"" malware family, as identified by multiple antivirus engines, including Symantec and Avast. The detection statistics reveal that out of the 67 engines that analyzed the file, 48 identified it as malicious, flagging it predominantly as adware, a downloader, or a potentially unwanted application (PUA). Notably, engines like Kaspersky and BitDefender labeled it with terms indicating its nature as a downloader or generic application. These results suggest that the malware could potentially be involved in distributing additional unwanted or harmful software to affected systems.

The file leverages Windows executables (PE32) for the Microsoft Windows environment, supporting the detection by engines of API imports typically associated with manipulative installations or persistent mechanisms. However, no specific Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) such as URLs, IPs, or domains were provided in this context. The file was signed with a certificate from ""Code Techno,"" which is no longer valid, potentially indicating an attempt to evade detection. No specific YARA rules or MITRE ATT&CK tactics were applicable to this file in the provided dataset. The key risk posed by this malware is its ability to download additional programs, which may lead to more severe infections. As a countermeasure, it is recommended to employ comprehensive security solutions with updated definitions and to ensure that suspicious files do not gain execution privileges. Possible mitigations include restricting admin rights for applications and regularly auditing installed software for unauthorized applications."
origin_14607__.tmp0.json.json,"The analyzed file is identified as part of the malware family associated with the MSIL/Kryptik and Androm strains. This determination is based on the multiple antivirus engines that flagged it as malicious, such as MicroWorld-eScan, FireEye, McAfee, and Kaspersky, identifying it specifically as Gen:Heur.MSIL.Androm.3, Trojan.MSIL, and HEUR:Trojan.MSIL.Generic, among others. The detection rate is high, with 52 engines marking it as malicious, and no engines labeling it as harmless or suspicious. This suggests that the file exhibits behaviors consistent with known malicious indicators, such as possibly executing .NET assemblies or leveraging Visual C++ characteristics in its executable form.

The file's detailed behavior was not discussed in terms of specific Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) like URLs or IP addresses, sandbox results, or community discussions, suggesting limited shared experiential data beyond the detected threat. However, the presence of a high reputation score (-46) and numerous alternative names implies some community awareness and interactions, potentially in forums or security discussions about its threat level. In terms of containment and mitigation, effective countermeasures could include updating antivirus definitions regularly given the wide detection, implementing software restriction policies to prevent unknown executable execution, and employing comprehensive network monitoring to quickly identify and mitigate unusual activities. It is also advisable to educate users on not executing suspicious downloads to prevent such malware from spreading. Additional mitigations could involve employing endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions to block and identify similar threats based on behavioral patterns."

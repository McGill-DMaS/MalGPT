    "File Name": "vt-origin_11840__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The analyzed file appears to belong to the malware families Androm and Loki, as indicated by multiple antivirus engines detecting this file as associated with these trojans and ransomware. This includes results like W32.AIDetectMalware, Trojan.Win32.Androm, Gen:Variant.Ransom.Loki, and others, demonstrating a high level of confidence in the malicious nature of the file. Out of all checkups, 64 engines identified the file as malicious, with no benign findings, underlining its harmful nature. The presence of file characteristics such as a PE32 executable file type and associations with Microsoft Visual Basic 6 further supports this classification. \n\nIn terms of sandbox analysis, the file has been categorized as both malware and a trojan by Lastline, suggesting capabilities that may involve data exfiltration, persistence, and communication with remote command and control (C2) servers typical of such malware families. This analysis did not highlight specific Infrastructure Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) like URLs or IPs, nor were any community discussions, identified YARA rules, or MITRE ATT&CK tactics explicitly detailed. To counteract such threats, implementing robust detection measures, regular software updates, employee training, and deploying behavioral analysis tools could be effective. Additionally, maintaining network isolation practices can prevent the spread of malware within corporate networks should an attack occur."

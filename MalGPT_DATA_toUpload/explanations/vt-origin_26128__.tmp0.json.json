    "File Name": "vt-origin_26128__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The malware file analyzed appears to belong to the Solimba adware family, as evidenced by multiple antivirus engines labeling it as such. Prominent detections include AV engines like McAfee identifying it as \"Artemis!95D47CE813AE,\" Kaspersky referring to it as \"not-a-virus:AdWare.Win32.Solimba.bi,\" and Malwarebytes calling it \"PUP.Optional.Solimba.\" The detection statistics reveal that 51 engines have flagged the file as malicious, with results indicating various adware and potentially unwanted program (PUP) classifications. The file is noted to have a signed certificate, which might be used to evade some security checks, but the certificate is reported as not time valid, suggesting it's an attempt to cloak malicious intent.\n\nThe file exhibits characteristics typical of adware, such as a tendency to bundle with legitimate applications and potentially unwanted behaviors like the display of unwanted ads or altering user settings without consent. No specific Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) like URLs, IPs, or domains were mentioned, nor were there sandbox results or MITRE ATT&CK techniques explicitly outlined in the provided data. However, the significant risk identified is related to its potential to disrupt user activity through ad display and compromised privacy by tracking user behavior. To mitigate the threats posed by this file, users are advised to use robust endpoint protection solutions capable of blocking adware and PUPs, maintain updated antivirus software, and consider employing ad-blockers to further safeguard against intrusive adware activities."

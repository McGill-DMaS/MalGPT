    "Explanation": "The analyzed file \"NationalInstruments.Common.dll\" appears benign based on its classification by the majority of antivirus engines, where it is labeled as \"undetected,\" with only Sangfor identifying it as \"Suspicious.Win32.Save.a.\" In addition, the DAS-Security Orcas sandbox verdict categorized it as \"harmless\" with a \"CLEAN\" malware classification. Despite being detected as suspicious by one engine, this particular DLL is associated with National Instruments software, specifically Measurement Studio for Visual Studio, and its attributes are consistent with typical components used in software libraries rather than malicious code.\n\nDetection statistics indicate a low risk, with only 1 out of numerous antivirus engines flagging it as potentially malicious. There are no identified Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), such as URLs, domains, or IP addresses, nor any significant sandbox activity suggesting malicious behavior like persistence or encryption. Additionally, there are no MITRE ATT&CK tactics, community discussions, or YARA rule triggers that denote malicious activity. Given its benign evaluation, the primary countermeasure is regular updates of antivirus definitions to ensure accurate detection. In case of doubt, further file analysis, monitoring system behavior, and consulting security forums may help clarify any suspicions."

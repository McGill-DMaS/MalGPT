    "File Name": "vt-0acb075b003dde9b08cd0278209700e0137aa72199644ad1ed31bfc6c93253cd.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file analyzed, identified as \"Microsoft.Performance.UI.dll,\" appears to be benign. Despite its characterization as a dynamic-link library (DLL) for Windows, no antivirus engines flagged it as malicious or suspicious. Antivirus detection statistics indicate that 70 engines marked it as undetected, with no engines reporting it as malicious. The file is verified by multiple digital signatures from Microsoft, although some signatures have expired. There is no evidence of known malware families or suspicious activities such as communication with suspicious URLs, IP addresses, or domains, nor any notable YARA rules or signatures detected.\n\nThe sandbox analysis categorizes the file as harmless, and no malicious behaviors such as persistence, encryption activities, or command and control communications (C2) were observed. Consequently, no specific MITRE ATT&CK tactics or techniques are linked to it. There are no community discussions identifying this file as malicious or risky. As for mitigation, the file appears to be legitimate, but it is advisable to maintain updated security protocols, including monitoring for any changes or anomalies and configuring systems to verify the legitimacy of software signatures to prevent potential exploitation of such files by threat actors in future scenarios."

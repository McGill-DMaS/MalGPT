The lack of any detection or suspicious activity suggests that the file is safe and likely a component of the Windows operating environment.\n\nFurthermore, the sandbox verdict from DAS-Security Orcas also corroborates the benign status by categorizing the file as harmless. There are no indicators of compromise such as malicious URLs, IPs, or domains associated with this file, nor are there any relevant YARA rules, signatures, or community discussions suggesting malicious behavior.

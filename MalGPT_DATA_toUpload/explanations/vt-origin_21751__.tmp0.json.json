    "File Name": "vt-origin_21751__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file appears to belong to the Downloader.Win32.DownloAdmin family, a type of potentially unwanted application (PUA) that is often associated with adware. Various antivirus engines identified it as malicious, with distinct detections such as Application.Generic, Adware.Downware, and Trojan.Win32 save instances. The majority of antivirus engines flagged the file as malicious, noting the presence of adware-like behaviors, though some classified it as a Trojan or downloader, indicating its potential to download other malicious contents. The detection rate is relatively high, with 61 out of several engines confirming its harmful status.\n\nThe file has been submitted multiple times for analysis, yet does not reveal URLs, IPs, or domains in the publicly available records. It contains a digital signature belonging to \"Code Techno\"; however, this certificate is noted as not time-valid. While specific YARA rules or MITRE ATT&CK tactics are not explicitly documented, the file\u2019s behavior includes registry manipulations (ADVAPI32.dll imports) and possible persistence mechanisms via interactions with system directories (KERNEL32.dll functions). No detailed sandbox analysis results or community discussions were directly mentioned. To mitigate against such threats, updating antivirus definitions regularly and practicing cautious downloading and installation habits are recommended. Countermeasures may include the use of robust antimalware solutions capable of detecting and preventing adware installations."

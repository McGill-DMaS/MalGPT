    "File Name": "vt-0b6d29118c299ca4afc5da807b3370eeb49a603697ef9942ba9b42ff705ea1fc.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file analyzed appears to be benign, as evidenced by the absence of any malicious detections from antivirus engines. All 71 engines returned an \"undetected\" status, indicating that it is not recognized as malicious by any of the applied security solutions. The file in question is a Windows DLL associated with Microsoft SQL Server, and it is signed and verified by Microsoft, further supporting its legitimacy. The report does not list any associated Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) such as malicious URLs, IP addresses, or domains. There are no mentions of YARA rules or specific signatures or sandbox results indicating suspicious activities or behaviors such as persistence, encryption activities, or command-and-control (C2) communications.\n\nGiven these findings, the file does not appear to align with any known malware family or exhibit behavior typically associated with malicious software. No MITRE ATT&CK tactics or techniques are identified, nor are there significant community discussions suggesting its potential risk. Therefore, the key behavior indicates a low risk of threat. Recommended countermeasures involve maintaining updated security software and regularly verifying the legitimacy of software signatures. As a mitigation strategy, ensuring a robust security policy that includes monitoring and auditing DLL files for unusual changes or access patterns would further reduce potential risks."

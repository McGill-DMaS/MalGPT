With 52 malicious detections from antivirus software, including notable names such as McAfee, Symantec, and Microsoft, the file is broadly recognized for malicious behavior. The detection results commonly label the file under terms like Adware, PUA, and Riskware, indicating its primary action likely involves unwanted advertising activities, user data tracking, or bundling additional unwelcome software components.\n\nThere are no specific Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) like URLs or IPs directly associated with this file in the provided data. Within this context, the lack of detailed sandbox analysis, such as MITRE ATT&CK tactics, suggests limited persistence or sophisticated evasion tactics. Given the confirmed classification of PUA, users are advised to treat the file with caution. To mitigate the risks posed by such adware, employing robust ad-blocking tools, maintaining updated antivirus definitions, and adhering to strict software download hygiene are recommended preventative measures. Continual monitoring for new variants and utilization of security solutions capable of detecting and mitigating adware threats effectively are also advised."

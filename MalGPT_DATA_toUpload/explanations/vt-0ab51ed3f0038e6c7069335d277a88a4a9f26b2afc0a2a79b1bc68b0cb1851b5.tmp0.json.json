    "Explanation": "The file \"AMAUtilLib20.dll,\" appears benign as evidenced by the analysis results from multiple antivirus engines, all of which have categorized it as undetected or harmless across 65 systems. The file is associated with the product \"Avid Media Access (AMA),\" indicating it is likely a utility library DLL for media access, a legitimate application. The signed certificate further attests to its authenticity, despite the fact that some certificates in its chain have expired. No indications of malicious activity, suspicious behaviors, or C2 (command and control) capabilities were found, which is corroborated by sandbox verdicts marking it as clean.\n\nIn terms of detection, there were no malicious tags or signatures detected by any antivirus solutions. The file lacks any known IOCs such as URLs, IPs, or domains and no YARA rules or signatures are associated with it. Similarly, no MITRE ATT&CK tactics or techniques could be identified, highlighting a lack of suspicious behavior common in malware. As a general precaution, ensuring software comes from a trusted source and keeping security software updated can act as effective counter measures. Given the outdated certificate, routine verification of software and digital signatures should be practiced, and it may be advantageous to update the signing certificates if this software continues to be distributed."

    "File Name": "vt-origin_25877__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file \"setup_install.exe\" is identified as malicious and belongs to the Firseria malware family, as indicated by multiple antivirus engines. Notably, DrWeb classifies it as \"Trojan.DownLoader11.3686,\" and several engines, including Symantec, Microsoft, and Kaspersky, detect it as adware or as a potential unwanted application related to the Solimba family. The majority of engines identified the file as malicious, with some specifically linking it to downloaders and bundlers which are known for propagating potentially unwanted programs (PUPs) or other malware. There are no specific IOCs such as URLs, IPs, or domains directly mentioned, nor are any unique YARA rules or significant sandbox results highlighted. However, the persistence, execution of unwanted applications, and downloading other malicious files could be inferred as key risks associated with this file.\n\nThe key behaviors exhibited by this malware revolve around adware activities, potentially installing additional unwanted software, hijacking user settings, and possibly exfiltrating user data. It utilizes social engineering to deceive users into downloading and executing the file, commonly through bundling with legitimate software. To mitigate the risks associated with this file, it is crucial for users and organizations to employ robust antivirus solutions that can detect such PUPs and potential downloaders. Implementing endpoint security measures that block malicious file execution, regularly updating software to patch vulnerabilities, and educating users about safe software practices can also significantly reduce the risks associated with such malware."

    "File Name": "vt-0ac7d0327d381dc33643c681e79ab3a3f9e3c25019237aaf804334893f53f48c.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file \"AEM.Plugin.Source.Kit.Server.dll\" appears to be benign, as all 54 antivirus engines that scanned it have reported it as \"undetected.\" This lack of detection across multiple engines strongly suggests that the file does not contain malicious content. Additionally, it is classified as a \"Win32 DLL,\" which aligns with its metadata indicating it is a component of the Catalyst Control Center software from Advanced Micro Devices Inc. The reputation score is neutral, and the file has not flagged any suspicious or malicious activities in sandbox environments, further supporting its harmless nature.\n\nNo specific indicators of compromise (IOCs) such as URLs, IPs, or domains are associated with this file, nor are there any relevant YARA rules, signatures, MITRE ATT&CK tactics, or techniques identified. The only community discussions presented are potential interpretations of the file's role related to AEM Event Source Plug-ins, emphasizing that it is part of legitimate software. As the file does not pose any immediate threat, mitigation measures are unnecessary. Standard security practices, such as keeping all software up to date and monitoring for any unexpected system behavior, are recommended to maintain system integrity."

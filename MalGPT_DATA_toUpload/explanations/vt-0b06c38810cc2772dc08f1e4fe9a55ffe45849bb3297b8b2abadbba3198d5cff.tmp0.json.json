    "File Name": "vt-0b06c38810cc2772dc08f1e4fe9a55ffe45849bb3297b8b2abadbba3198d5cff.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file analyzed appears to be benign, as indicated by the detailed analysis results from multiple antivirus engines, all of which returned \"undetected\" for malicious activity. The file, titled \"cook3260.DLL,\" is identified as a \"Cooker G2 Audio Codec for RealAudio\" used in Windows (.DLL), typically associated with legitimate software rather than malicious purposes. Both sandbox verdicts from Zenbox and DAS-Security Orcas classified the file as \"harmless.\" There is no detection of malicious behavior, persistence capabilities, command-and-control features, or other threats identified in YARA rules or community discussions about malware activity.\n\nDetection statistics confirmed its benign status, with all 68 antivirus engines reporting \"undetected\" for potential threats. The file did not exhibit any MITRE ATT&CK tactics or techniques associated with cyber adversaries. Community discussions did not reveal concerns or suspicions regarding this particular file. Given its classification as a benign file related to an audio codec, no specific countermeasures are required apart from the standard practices of maintaining updated antivirus software, monitoring for abnormal network activity, and ensuring software legitimacy. For potential mitigation, ensuring that the file comes from a trusted source and keeping the system's software and security patches updated can effectively prevent exploitation by similar constructs."

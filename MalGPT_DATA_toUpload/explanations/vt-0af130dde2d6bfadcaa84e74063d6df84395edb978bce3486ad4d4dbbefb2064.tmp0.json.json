    "File Name": "vt-0af130dde2d6bfadcaa84e74063d6df84395edb978bce3486ad4d4dbbefb2064.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The analyzed file, identified as \"acge18d.dll,\" appears to be benign. This verdict is based on several factors, including its classification by DAS-Security Orcas as \"harmless\" with a clean malware classification and no detections of malicious activity by any of the antivirus engines used for analysis. Furthermore, it is associated with reputable certificates, including Autodesk, Inc. and VeriSign Class 3 Code Signing, albeit with certificates not time-valid at the point of check. The file attributes also suggest its nature as a legitimate Win32 DLL related to Autodesk software.\n\nDetection statistics reveal no reports of malicious activity, with a complete absence of detections across multiple antivirus engines. The file does not exhibit known Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), and no YARA rules or specific signatures were triggered during the analysis. There were no sandbox results indicating persistence, encryption, or attempts to establish command-and-control (C2) communication. Consequently, no MITRE ATT&CK tactics were identifiable. Hence, due to the benign nature of this file, there are no community discussions indicating security concerns, nor are there significant behaviors or risks to highlight. As such, maintaining regular antivirus updates and continuing software authenticity verifications are general countermeasures and mitigations sufficient for handling this file securely."

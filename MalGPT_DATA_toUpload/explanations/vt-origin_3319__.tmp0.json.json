Multiple antivirus engines, including well-known names like Symantec, Avast, and Kaspersky, have marked this file as malicious, categorizing it under various classifications such as adware, potentially unwanted applications, and generic trojans. The file is described as a Win32 EXE with notable detections like \"PUA.DownloadAdmin\" and \"Trojan.Gen.2,\" indicating its potential to act as a downloader or adware. Given its signature issues, including an expired certificate signed by \"Code Techno,\" the file poses a threat characterized by unauthorized software bundling and possible data exposure.\n\nThe detection statistics reveal a significant consensus across 62 antivirus engines, flagging this file as malicious with no recorded benign or undetected status. Although specific indicators of compromise (IOCs) such as URLs, IPs, or domains are not listed in the data, the implied risks involve software distribution without user consent, unauthorized modifications, and potential data leakage. Countermeasures against such a threat include employing reputable security software capable of detecting PUAs and regularly updating systems to patch known vulnerabilities. Mitigation can involve educating users on the dangers of bundled applications and enforcing strict execution policies to prevent unauthorized software installations."

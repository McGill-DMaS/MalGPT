Specifically, the file was categorized as 'undetected' across the numerous engines, with no reports of malicious behavior. The file description and type, a PE32 DLL, suggest it is a component meant for use within Windows environments. Notably, the digital signature associated with the file is from Websurf Technology Inc., which, although it has been revoked, does not align with typically malicious behavior observed in malware.\n\nIn terms of indicators of compromise (IOCs), there are no URLs, IP addresses, or domains associated with this file, suggesting no immediate concerns about network-based threats such as command and control (C2) communications. Furthermore, there are no identified YARA rules or specific threat signatures linked to this file. Sandbox verdicts classify it as harmless, with no suspicious activities related to persistence, encryption, or other typical malicious actions. The overall behavior of the file does not indicate any risks, and as a possible mitigation, maintaining updates to antivirus definitions and monitoring revoked certificates could provide an additional layer of security."

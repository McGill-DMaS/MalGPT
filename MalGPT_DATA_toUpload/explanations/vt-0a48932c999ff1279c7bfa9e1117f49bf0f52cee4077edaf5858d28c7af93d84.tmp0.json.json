    "File Name": "vt-0a48932c999ff1279c7bfa9e1117f49bf0f52cee4077edaf5858d28c7af93d84.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The provided file details do not indicate the presence of any known malware family and appear to be benign. This is corroborated by the fact that the file \"SDL.dll\" was historically associated with legitimate software products such as \"Attack on Pearl Harbor,\" distributed by Legendo Entertainment. Furthermore, none of the 74 antivirus engines returned a positive detection; all results were categorized as 'undetected,' reinforcing the benign nature of the file. There was a single failure in detection, and four engines identified it as 'type-unsupported,' which are common for certain portable executables handling metadata not influenced by malicious code.\n\nNo associated indicators of compromise (IOCs), such as suspicious URLs, IPs, or domains, were detected, nor were there any YARA rules or signatures triggered. Sandbox analysis did not reveal any malicious behaviors, such as encryption, command and control communication (C2), or persistence mechanisms. Without indication of suspicious activity or harmful intent, MITRE ATT&CK tactics and community discussions were also absent. As there are no immediate threats identified, no specific countermeasures or mitigations are required. However, continuing to monitor updates from both the file's software publisher and security vendors remains a prudent strategy for ensuring on-going software safety."

    "Explanation": "Based on the provided details, no relevant information is available about the specified file due to a \"NotFoundError.\" This indicates that there might be a hash mismatch or the file is not present in the analyzed database. Without specific data to analyze, we cannot determine the malware family, its features, or assess the file's benign status.\n\nSince there is no match for the file, several crucial aspects such as detection statistics from antivirus engines, associated Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) like URLs or IPs, and YARA rules are unavailable. Additionally, without sandbox analyses or community discussions input, we cannot summarize potential risks, behaviors, or propose countermeasures and mitigation strategies. For a comprehensive analysis, verifying the file hash or resubmitting the file through a different analysis method might be necessary."

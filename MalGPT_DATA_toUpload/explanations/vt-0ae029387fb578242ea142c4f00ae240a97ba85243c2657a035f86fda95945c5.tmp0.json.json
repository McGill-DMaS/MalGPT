    "Explanation": "The file in question, identified as amqcctca.dll, appears to be benign. This conclusion is drawn from the fact that none of the 64 antivirus engines that analyzed the file reported it as malicious or suspicious, all categorizing it as undetected or harmless. This DLL file is signed and seems to be a component of IBM WebSphere MQ for Windows, evidenced by signature information referencing IBM UK Ltd. and verified by VeriSign. As for the detection statistics, there were no indications of malicious behavior or detections, reinforcing its benign nature.\n\nIn terms of sandbox analysis, the file was classified as \"CLEAN\" by DAS-Security Orcas, with no indications of persistence mechanisms, encryption activities, or command and control (C2) server communications identified. Moreover, no MITRE ATT&CK tactics or techniques were applicable, no YARA rules or signatures were triggered, and community discussions did not highlight any adverse behaviors associated with this file. Given its benign classification, standard system hygiene practices, such as keeping software up to date and verifying the authenticity of installed applications, serve as adequate countermeasures. There are no specific mitigation steps necessary beyond standard security protocols."

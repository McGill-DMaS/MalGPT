    "File Name": "vt-0c1623c6ca2a81eefe8ab5f32cfaebbf54716304178c774a56a68cdb152c8ae9.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The analyzed file, identified as \"NMOEMCustomisation.dll,\" appears to be benign. Despite being signed by reputable certificates from Nero AG, VeriSign, and Thawte, the certificates have expired. However, the file's behavior and attributes do not indicate malicious activity. Multiple antivirus engines, totaling over 55, analyzed the file and found no evidence of malicious intent. The file is regarded as clean by DAS-Security Orcas, further corroborating its benign nature. No indicators of compromise (IOCs) such as malicious URLs, IPs, or domains were associated with the file. No relevant YARA rules or signatures were triggered, and the file's structure and imports are typical for a Win32 DLL.\n\nSandbox evaluations confirmed the absence of suspicious behaviors like persistence mechanisms, encryption operations, or communications with command-and-control (C2) servers. Consequently, no tactics or techniques from the MITRE ATT&CK framework were applicable. Community discussions have not highlighted any concerns regarding this file, reinforcing its benign status. While the file does not pose risks, general countermeasures such as keeping software up-to-date and implementing robust security protocols are always recommended. Given these factors, the recommended mitigation is to maintain the file within its operational context unless further evidence suggests a change in its threat posture."

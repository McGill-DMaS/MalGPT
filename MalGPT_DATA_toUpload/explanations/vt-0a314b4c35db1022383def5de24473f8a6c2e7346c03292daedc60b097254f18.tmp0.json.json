    "File Name": "vt-0a314b4c35db1022383def5de24473f8a6c2e7346c03292daedc60b097254f18.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The analysis of the file 'jfutility.dll', identified as a PE32 executable (DLL) for MS Windows, suggests that it is likely benign. Notably, none of the 71 antivirus engines detected it as malicious, and it bears a signature from Adobe Systems for XML Form Architecture's Utility Library, indicating it is likely used for legitimate purposes. The file's detection by VirusTotal shows no malicious or suspicious results, aligning with its legitimate signature and the reported protections from DAS-Security Orcas marking it as \"harmless.\" \n\nThere are no indications of associated IOCs, YARA rules, or MITRE ATT&CK tactics, suggesting no known patterns of malicious behavior. Given its benign status, the primary countermeasure is to ensure its source is verified to prevent tampered versions being installed. Regular updating of antivirus software and applying strict access control measures can help mitigate risks posed by unknown or modified versions. Monitoring community discussions for any emerging threats related to this file name could also be prudent."

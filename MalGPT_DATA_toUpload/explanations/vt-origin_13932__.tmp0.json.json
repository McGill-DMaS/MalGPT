    "File Name": "vt-origin_13932__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file in question is a confirmed malicious executable belonging to the Ursnif malware family, also known as Gozi ISFB or Dreambot, which is a well-known banking trojan. Approximately 58 antivirus engines have flagged it as malicious, with specific detections such as Trojan.Win32.Ursnif.l!c, Spyware.Ursnif, and Trojan-Spy.Win32.Ursnif.adwh. These detections indicate its capability to intercept sensitive user data, especially banking credentials. The file has a reputation score of -24, further underscoring its dangerous nature. Although community discussions are not highlighted, its frequent submission (31 times) suggests heightened vigilance from the cybersecurity community.\n\nObserved behaviors and risks associated with this sample include code injection, detected by the high-level Sigma rules signifying suspicious svchost.exe activity, hinting at process hollowing or similar techniques used for persistence and stealth. The file exhibits characteristics like detecting debug environments and long sleep functions. Despite the absence of explicit indications of network activity such as C2 communication URLs or IP addresses in the available data, its malware family is known for establishing persistence and data exfiltration. Recommended countermeasures include employing behavior-based detection systems that can identify non-signature-based threats, ensuring that systems are patched to defend against known vulnerabilities, and applying strict application whitelisting to prevent execution of unauthorized applications. Regularly updating antivirus software and educating users on phishing risks could mitigate the impact of such threats."

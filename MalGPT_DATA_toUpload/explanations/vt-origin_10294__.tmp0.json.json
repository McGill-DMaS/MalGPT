    "File Name": "vt-origin_10294__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file identified by its attributes and analysis results appears to be malicious, associated primarily with the DownloadAdmin malware family, categorized as potentially unwanted software or adware. Detection statistics from antivirus scanners indicate that 49 engines have marked it as malicious, with various labels such as \"Application.Bundler.KJ,\" \"Win32:DownloadAdmin-BE [Adw],\" and \"W32/S-ef186202!Eldorado.\" The file is recognized for distributing unwanted programs and displaying adware characteristics, which is a common trait of the DownloadAdmin family. The presence of a code-signing certificate labeled \"Code Techno,\" though not time-valid, may be a tactic to impart legitimacy.\n\nAlthough specific IOCs like URLs, IPs, and domains aren't explicitly mentioned, the rich set of imported DLLs, such as ADVAPI32.dll for registry manipulation and KERNEL32.dll for file processes, suggest significant functionality. The file imports numerous functions from USER32.dll, enabling the malware to interact with the Windows user interface possibly to perform unwanted activities like showing advertisements or creating pop-ups. There are no mentions of YARA rules, MITRE ATT&CK tactics, or identified persistency activities. To mitigate the risks posed by such malware, it's recommended to enact rigorous endpoint protection policies, ensuring all downloads come from trusted sites, and educating users on recognizing suspicious activities. Regular audits and updates of antivirus definitions can act as a preventative measure against potentially unwanted programs."

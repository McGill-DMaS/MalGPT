    "File Name": "vt-0b6bbc0b3e9aa5150cbaf01db64379805fd7e8716bb649e242af24836e0fd3a7.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "Based on the analysis of the file identified as \"CPApplet.dll,\" it appears to be a benign component. This conclusion is drawn from the analysis results indicating that all antivirus engines classified it as \"undetected\" with no malicious findings across a variety of engines. The file is signed by Intel Corporation, and it is identified as an \"Intel PROSet/Wireless Control Panel Applet,\" suggesting its legitimate use associated with Intel's wireless networking software. Furthermore, the digital signature information, along with its alignment with a known product, provides additional assurance regarding its authenticity and benign nature.\n\nIn terms of detection statistics, 69 antivirus engines recorded no malicious activity, all classifying it as undetected, while five engines flagged it as type-unsupported, which is not uncommon for legitimate software components not typically analyzed by mobile or specialized malware engines. There are no associated indicators of compromise (IOCs) such as URLs, IPs, or domains linked to suspicious activities, nor were any YARA rules, suspicious signatures, or behaviors identified by sandbox environments, such as persistence mechanisms or command-and-control (C2) communications. Consequently, there are no noted risks or malicious behaviors, and thus, no specific countermeasures or mitigations are needed. Users are advised to ensure that this file is used within the context of Intel's suite to mitigate any potential misuse, and they should maintain general system safeguards and updates to prevent unauthorized access or tampering."

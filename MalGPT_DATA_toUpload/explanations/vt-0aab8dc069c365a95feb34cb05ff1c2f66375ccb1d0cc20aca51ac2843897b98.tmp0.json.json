The file's attributes, such as the lack of suspicious URLs, IPs, domains, or identified YARA rules, further confirm its harmless status. The absence of suspicious sandbox activity and MITRE ATT&CK references highlights no adversary tactics associated with this file. As a precaution, ensuring that systems utilize the correct and updated version of the MSXML3A.dll can help mitigate any potential risks associated with outdated or compromised copies.

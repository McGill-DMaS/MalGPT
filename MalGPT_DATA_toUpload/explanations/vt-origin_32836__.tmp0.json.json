    "File Name": "vt-origin_32836__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file under analysis belongs to multiple malware families, primarily associated with adware and potentially unwanted applications (PUA). Identified notably by several major antivirus engines such as Bkav, Elastic, and McAfee as malicious, it is often classified with names like W32.AIDetectGBM.malware.01 and Application.Generic.1646377. With 58 detections from leading antivirus vendors, the file is characterized as a downloader, posing risks of downloading adware to the victim's system. The presence of a time-invalid Code Signing certificate from \"Code Techno\" further raises suspicion about its trustworthiness, despite being signed.\n\nKey indicators of compromise (IOCs) include various threat names from antivirus detections, yet no specific URLs or IPs are detailed. No YARA rules are explicitly mentioned, and no sandbox results (such as persistence or C2 communications) are provided. While no specific tactics from the MITRE ATT&CK framework are noted, behaviors typical of adware such as system modification and network communications for downloading additional payloads are inferred. Countermeasures include removing this executable from systems and applying security patches. Mitigation involves deploying comprehensive antimalware solutions and educating users on the risks of downloading and executing unsigned software."

    "File Name": "vt-origin_23155__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The analyzed file is identified as a malicious executable belonging to the DownloadAdmin malware family, predominantly categorized as a \"Potentially Unwanted Application\" (PUA) or adware by multiple antivirus engines. Specifically, it has been detected as malicious by 58 different antivirus vendors, such as DrWeb labeling it as \"Adware.Downware.2220\" and Symantec as \"Trojan.Gen.2\". The file's characteristics suggest it is involved in potentially undesirable behaviors, like adware installation and deceptive download management, often bundled with third-party software. Despite being signed by \"Code Techno,\" the certificate has expired, further indicating suspicious intent.\n\nAlongside high entropy values in the file sections hinting at packed or obfuscated content, the file imports numerous Registry-related and file manipulation functions, suggesting potential persistent and invasive operations on infected systems. Notably, no specific legitimate YARA rules or sandbox results such as persistence or encryption activities are mentioned, nor there is any reference to URLs, IPs, or domains, indicating a lack of network-based IOCs. However, given its detection as adware, users should be wary of privacy invasion and unwanted ads display. Mitigation should focus on thorough vetting of software installations, use of reputable antivirus programs, and regular system audits to detect and remove such invasive applications."

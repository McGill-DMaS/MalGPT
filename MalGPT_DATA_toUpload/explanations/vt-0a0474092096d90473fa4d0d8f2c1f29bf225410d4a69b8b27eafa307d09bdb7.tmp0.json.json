It is primarily recognized as a PE32 executable for MS Windows (DLL), associated with Intel's PROSet/Wireless Advanced Statistics Module, and has not been flagged as malicious by any of the 66 antivirus engines in the VirusTotal database. All engines categorized it as \"undetected,\" suggesting no malicious behavior was recognized. Sandbox verdicts further classified this file as \"harmless,\" with no indications of persistence, encryption, or command-and-control communication typical of malware activities. \n\nNo Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) such as URLs, IPs, or domains have been associated with this file, and there are no identified YARA rules or specific signatures marking it as malicious. As a result, there are no relevant MITRE ATT&CK techniques, community discussions, or concerning behaviors or risks identified. Given the absence of any malicious indicators and the legitimate signature information, no specific counter measures or mitigation strategies are necessary. If any deviation from expected behavior occurs, ensuring the file is from a legitimate source or re-evaluating it in an isolated environment might be beneficial."

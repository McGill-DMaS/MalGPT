    "File Name": "vt-0ad95d0e0fc2400b8b0c433517eade09f831c785fccfcabb86ef8bbdaa54c450.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file identified as \"api-ms-win-core-util-l1-1-0.dll\" appears to be benign. This assessment is primarily due to the trusted verdict from Microsoft Corporation, indicating the file is classified as \"goodware\". Additionally, the antivirus analysis across multiple engines did not flag the file as malicious, with all major antivirus software reporting the file as \"undetected\". This zero detection rate further supports its benign status. The file seems to serve as a legitimate component of the Microsoft Windows Operating System, specifically an ApiSet Stub DLL, as suggested by the file signature and description. \n\nGiven the benign nature of the file, no suspicious Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) like URLs, IPs, or domains were associated with it, nor were there any identifiable YARA rules or signatures applicable. Sandbox analysis results classified the file as \"clean,\" with no malicious behaviors such as persistence, encryption, or command and control (C2) activities observed. As such, there are no reported tactics or techniques from the MITRE ATT&CK framework linked to the file, nor were any community discussions flagged for caution. Due to its benign nature, there are no key risks associated with this file, thus specific countermeasures or mitigations are unnecessary. However, maintaining regular system updates and using reputable antivirus software can help prevent any potential issues with other files."

    "Explanation": "The file in question, identified as \"System.Web.dll,\" appears to be benign, as confirmed by its \"goodware\" verdict from Microsoft Corporation. The file is a Win32 DLL associated with Microsoft\u00ae .NET Framework, and bears characteristics typical of legitimate software, such as a valid signature and detailed signature information suggestive of official Microsoft distribution. No antivirus engines have labeled it as malicious or suspicious, with 65 engines not detecting any threats, corroborating its benign status.\n\nSandbox verdicts further classify the file as \"harmless,\" with zero indicators of malicious behavior like persistence mechanisms, encryption activities, or command-and-control communication. There are no detected MITRE ATT&CK techniques, community discussions highlighting concerns, or disruptive behaviors reported. As a trusted component, there are no Internet-connected IOCs such as suspicious URLs, IPs, or domains associated with it. Given the absence of malicious indicators, no specific countermeasures are necessary for this file. However, general best practices include maintaining up-to-date antivirus software and deploying application whitelisting to protect against any unforeseen risks."

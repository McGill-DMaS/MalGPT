    "Explanation": "The analyzed file, identified as \"vbscript.dll,\" appears to be benign. There are no indications of malicious behavior; the file was undetected by all antivirus engines according to the latest analysis, with zero flags for malicious or suspicious activity out of the 66 engines that reviewed it. Furthermore, the file's signature information confirms it as a Microsoft VBScript DLL with legitimate attributes such as a valid copyright, product, and version details aligning with those of benign software. The comprehensive import list aligns with typical function calls for a Windows DLL, with standard library dependencies.\n\nAs a benign Microsoft DLL without any detected malicious behavior, associated indicators of compromise (IOCs) such as URLs, IPs, or domains relevant to attacks are absent. The file has not triggered any YARA rules or signatures related to malware families, and sandboxing results have labeled it as \"harmless.\" There are no discussions or reports of abnormal behaviors, persistence mechanisms, or communication to a command and control server. Counter measures and mitigations are not necessary as the file poses no current risk, but maintaining updated antivirus definitions and system patches can ensure continued protection."

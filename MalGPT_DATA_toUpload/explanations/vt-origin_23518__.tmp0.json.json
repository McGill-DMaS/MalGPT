    "File Name": "vt-origin_23518__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The analyzed file, identified by multiple names including \"installer.exe\" and \"*intaller.exe*\", is classified as malicious by numerous antivirus engines, predominantly associated with the Solimba adware family and Firseria bundler applications. A vast majority of vendors detected it as potentially unwanted software (PUP) or adware, indicating its primary functions as a downloader and bundler of unwanted applications. The file is described as a Windows executable PE32, indicating it's tailored for Windows systems. The analysis does not indicate any benign status due to the high number of detections and the nature of its classifications.\n\nDetection statistics show that 62 out of the analyzed engines flagged the file as malicious, with some specifying variants of adware or downloader threats. The file also carries signatures linked to individual organizations like \"Bechiro S.L.\" and is reported to utilize libraries like KERNEL32.DLL for system-level operations, indicating an inclination towards system modification or disruption. While no specific IOCs such as URLs or IPs were identified, the presence of bundled applications suggests a capability for secondary payload downloads. The lack of detailed YARA rule matches or MITRE ATT&CK mappings implies limited threat intelligence in these areas. Key behaviors include adware installation and potential system slowdowns or disruptions from bundled software. To mitigate risks, users should implement antivirus solutions to detect such malware and practice cautious downloading, such as avoiding unfamiliar or suspicious executable files."

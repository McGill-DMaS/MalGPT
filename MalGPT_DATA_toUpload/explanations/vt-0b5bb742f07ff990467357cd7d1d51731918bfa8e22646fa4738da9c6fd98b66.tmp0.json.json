    "File Name": "vt-0b5bb742f07ff990467357cd7d1d51731918bfa8e22646fa4738da9c6fd98b66.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The analyzed file appears to be benign, as indicated by the lack of detection from any antivirus engines, with all 69 engines listing it as undetected. Additionally, the file carries legitimate signatures associated with Autodesk, Inc., specifically for the AutoCAD\u00ae 2D Graphics System, although the certificate has expired, rendering the signature invalid under current conditions. The tags and attributes such as \"pedll\" and \"singed\" suggest that it is a benign executable file, possibly a legitimate AutoCAD DLL. The file was submitted once, adding to its benign assessment as it's likely not widely distributed or flagged.\n\nNo indicators of compromise (IOCs) such as malicious URLs, IPs, or domains are associated with this file, reinforcing its benign nature. Furthermore, no YARA rules or sandbox results suggest malicious behavior like persistence or C2 communications. Likewise, there are no known MITRE ATT&CK tactics or techniques or community discussions attributing any malicious characteristics. In summary, the file appears to be a legitimate component of the AutoCAD system with no key risky behaviors. To mitigate potential risk, users should ensure they are using up-to-date software and validate the credibility of files through reliable antivirus solutions, while also employing routine checks and audits of system environments."

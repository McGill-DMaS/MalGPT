    "File Name": "vt-0a917a4082f383eb7347ed0045357e80ef13d42033edae30d1b461d337c99b8c.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file analyzed is a Windows DLL named \"RemoteCtrlHook.dll,\" appearing to be benign as it has no detections from any of the 41 antivirus engines on VirusTotal, indicating no known malicious signatures associated with it. This is further substantiated by a report from the DAS-Security Orcas sandbox, classifying the file as clean, suggesting no malicious behaviors such as persistence, encryption activities, or communication with a C2 server. The file includes standard Windows API function imports related to registry operations and thread management, common in legitimate software. With no YARA rules or threatening indicators of compromise linked, there are no associated URLs, IPs, or domains reported.\n\nGiven its clean status and legitimate association with Microsoft Corp., it\u2019s likely this DLL is part of standard system operations or legitimate software designed to augment system functionality, specifically regarding remote control features. As a precautionary countermeasure, organizations should maintain a regular antivirus update schedule and enforce strict application whitelisting to ensure system integrity. Monitoring and evaluating unexpected or unauthorized DLL injections remain critical to preventing potential misuse. Employ network segmentation and least privilege principles as mitigation strategies to reduce the risk landscape if similar files are introduced into the network environment."

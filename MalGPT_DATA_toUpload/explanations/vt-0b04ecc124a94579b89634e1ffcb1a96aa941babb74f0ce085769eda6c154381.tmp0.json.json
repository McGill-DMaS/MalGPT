    "File Name": "vt-0b04ecc124a94579b89634e1ffcb1a96aa941babb74f0ce085769eda6c154381.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file analyzed appears benign, as corroborated by multiple antivirus engines that reported it as \"undetected\" or \"clean\" across all 68 engines included in the last analysis, with no malicious categorizations. The file, identified as a Windows DLL, is signed by Zhuhai Kingsoft Office Software Co., Ltd., which further indicates legitimacy. It is an executable associated with Kingsoft Office and is described as an \"Algorithm Library.\" The presence of a valid digital signature and the lack of any malicious triggers during comprehensive scanning contribute to asserting its benign nature.\n\nGiven the file's benign status, there are no Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) such as URLs, IPs, or domains associated with it, nor are there related YARA rules or signatures that suggest malicious activity. Sandbox analysis from DAS-Security Orcas concluded the file to be harmless. Consequently, there are no relevant MITRE ATT&CK tactics or techniques applicable. For users concerned about ensuring safety, a regular update of antivirus signatures and maintaining good cyber hygiene is advised as a countermeasure. As possible mitigation, always verify digital signatures and source authenticity before execution, especially in environments where data integrity is critical."

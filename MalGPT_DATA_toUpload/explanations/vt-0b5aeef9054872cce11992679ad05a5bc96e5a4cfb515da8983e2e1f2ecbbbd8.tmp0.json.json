    "File Name": "vt-0b5aeef9054872cce11992679ad05a5bc96e5a4cfb515da8983e2e1f2ecbbbd8.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The analyzed file, identified as \"SDL.dll,\" appears to be benign. This determination is based on various factors, including a classification of \"harmless\" by sandbox environments such as Zenbox and DAS-Security Orcas. Additionally, the majority of antivirus engines, including prominent ones like Kaspersky, Symantec, and McAfee, did not categorize the file as malicious. Only one engine, Cynet, flagged it as malicious with a high score, but this appears to be an outlier given the broader consensus from other engines. The file is associated with legitimate products, such as \"Finding Nemo: Nemo's Underwater World of Fun\" and \"Mahjongg,\" distributed by Topics Entertainment, further supporting its non-malicious nature.\n\nIn terms of detection statistics, the file was submitted 190 times, with a community vote indicating predominantly harmless opinions. It also lacks any significant Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) or suspicious YARA rule matches, and no suspicious behaviors were noted in sandbox analyses, such as network activity indicative of Command and Control (C2) communication or persistence mechanisms. The file aligns with regular Microsoft Visual C++ compiled DLL characteristics and appears in several legitimate software databases like the National Software Reference Library (NSRL). To mitigate potential false positives, thorough verification processes, white-listing known clean files, and regular updates of threat intelligence databases should be maintained."

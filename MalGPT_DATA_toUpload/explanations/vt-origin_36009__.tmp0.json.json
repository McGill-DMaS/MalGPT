    "File Name": "vt-origin_36009__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file analyzed is identified as malicious, categorized under various families including \"Trojan.Application.Bundler.Morstar\" and \"W32.Trojan.Application\". Detected by 49 antivirus engines, this file has been seen associated with potentially unwanted programs (PUPs) and adware, as identified by engines like Bkav, Kaspersky, and Microsoft. Notably, engines such as AVG and Avast flagged it as part of the \"Morstar\" family. The file is a signed Windows executable with a historical signing date from 2015, but its certificate chain is presently not time-valid, as detailed in its metadata.\n\nNo specific Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) such as URLs or IPs were provided, nor were any YARA rules explicitly mentioned. While explicit MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques are not outlined in this data, the file's classification as a Trojan and adware suggests tactics related to Defense Evasion and Discovery might be applicable. Key risks involve system persistence and the potential installation of additional unwanted software. Countermeasures include the use of updated antivirus solutions to detect and quarantine the threat, alongside user education to avoid downloading suspicious files. System administrators are encouraged to monitor for unusual outbound traffic and ensure operating systems are patched regularly to mitigate vulnerabilities exploited by such malware."

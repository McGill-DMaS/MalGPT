    "File Name": "vt-0b3ec4c04b3945c54aad3b9da44ab2fd5ed0d6d7999d93a0eec5c2bf38a7f662.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file analyzed here seems to be a benign Windows DLL associated with the Function Discovery WS Discovery Provider, a component of the Microsoft Windows Operating System. Despite being submitted and analyzed, it was not detected as malicious by any of the antivirus engines utilized, with 66 engines returning an \"undetected\" status and no engines marking it as suspicious or harmful. This suggests the file is likely legitimate and not recognized as malware by industry-standard antivirus tools.\n\nGiven the absence of findings for malicious activity, no specific indicators of compromise (IOCs) such as URLs, IPs, or domains were identified, and there were no YARA rules or signatures triggered that might indicate malicious behavior. Furthermore, there are no reported behaviors from sandbox analysis pointing to persistence mechanisms, data encryption, or communication with command-and-control (C2) servers. There were also no discussions in the community highlighting concerns or risks associated with this file. As such, no countermeasures or mitigations are deemed necessary at this time. It is recommended, however, to ensure that updates and patches are regularly applied to the operating system to avoid potential vulnerabilities in its components."

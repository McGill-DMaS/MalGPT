    "File Name": "vt-0ac339e618e7fcf222a884f41172b58237fd515bd7e61b4a86b154f53b51cd7d.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file `bcmihvsrv.dll` appears to be benign, primarily indicated by its undetected status across multiple antivirus engines. Despite being submitted twice and having its last analysis date on February 19, 2021, none of the 68 antivirus scans identified this file as malicious or suspicious. The file is associated with Broadcom's Native 802.11 WLAN IHV Service, which suggests that it is a legitimate system component. This notion is further supported by its signature information, including references to Broadcom Corporation and its classification in sandbox analysis by DAS-Security Orcas as 'clean.' The absence of alerts or detections in sandbox environments points towards its benign nature.\n\nIn terms of detection statistics, no indications were found that point to malicious behavior. Additionally, no specific indicators of compromise (IOCs), such as URLs, IPs, or domains, were identified alongside the file, and it lacked any matching YARA rules or signatures. Sandbox results reinforce this perception, indicating no malicious behaviors such as persistence, encryption activity, or command and control (C2) actions. There are no entries from MITRE ATT&CK or community discussions highlighting potential threats or tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). Consequently, no specific countermeasures or mitigations are recommended, as the file's context and behavior do not currently represent a risk. However, general prudent device management practices, such as maintaining up-to-date security software and regular system checks, are always advisable."

    "File Name": "vt-0acdc7e65b5ac592b54a6b31d411532545ee58302252c800601d7acd3d18e10b.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file \"xpsqlbot.dll\" appears to be benign based on the analysis by multiple antivirus engines. The detection statistics reveal that out of 71 scans, all have categorized it as undetected or failed to classify it as malicious or suspicious. This lack of detection across a comprehensive set of engines suggests the file is not currently recognized as a threat. The file is known to be a component of SQL Server, a legitimate software product by Microsoft, which lends further credibility to its benign status. Moreover, the file has a valid digital signature from Microsoft, which indicates authenticity and integrity.\n\nThere are no specific Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) such as URLs, IPs, or domains associated with this file. The sandbox analysis also marked it as clean, and no malicious behaviors such as persistence, encryption activities, or command-and-control (C2) communications were observed. There are no identified YARA rules or signatures linked to the file. Given its association with officially signed Microsoft products and absence in community discussions regarding malware, it poses minimal risk. As a countermeasure, continuous monitoring and updating of antivirus signatures are suggested to detect any possible future alteration. Regular system updates and verification of digital signatures represent a sensible mitigation strategy to ensure that similar benign files retain their integrity."

    "File Name": "vt-origin_20764__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The analyzed file is classified as malicious and belongs to the Morstar malware family, as indicated by multiple antivirus engines such as MicroWorld-eScan, BitDefender, and AVG. These engines have consistently detected it as a variant of a bundler or downloader, with over 51 engines categorizing the file as malicious, highlighting its potential risk. This executable file, with the tags 'peexe', 'via-tor', 'signed', and 'overlay', was likely distributed through Tor channels, potentially leveraging code signing to bypass basic security checks.\n\nFurthermore, the file shows characteristics of potentially unwanted programs (PUPs), often found installing other unwanted software on user systems without express consent. No specific indicators of compromise such as URLs, IPs, or domains are directly mentioned, nor are sandbox results detailed. Community discussions or YARA rules were not provided for this file. The malicious package implicates tactics and techniques like Payload Delivery from the MITRE ATT&CK matrix. As countermeasures, users should undertake software inventory checks, adjust allowlists, integrate behavioral detection solutions, and regularly update antivirus signatures. Additional possible mitigations include educating users about PUPs and enhancing monitoring of network traffic for unusual downloads prompted by unexpected software behavior."

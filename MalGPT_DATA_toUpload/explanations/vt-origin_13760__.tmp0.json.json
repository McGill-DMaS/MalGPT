    "File Name": "vt-origin_13760__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "This file is identified as malicious and belongs to the Morstar malware family, as indicated by various antivirus engines. Detection statistics reveal that 58 antivirus engines have flagged this file as malicious, with detections labeling it as Trojan, Adware, or Potentially Unwanted Applications (PUA). The result descriptions include Trojan.DownLoader11.57090 and Gen:Variant.Application.Bundler.Morstar.30, indicating its capacity to bundle and download additional unwanted software. The file was digitally signed by \"Vetaform Developments, s.l.\" but the certificates are not time-valid, which is a common tactic used to bypass security measures. The executable was primarily submitted under names such as \"7GYT05NV.exe,\" suggesting attempts at obfuscation or distribution under inconspicuous names. \n\nKey behaviors associated with Morstar include downloading additional payloads and persisting on infected systems. No specific Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) such as URLs, IPs, or identified YARA rules are detailed in this report. The MITRE ATT&CK framework does not directly map specific tactics or techniques to this report, but the potential techniques could include \"Execution\" and \"Persistence.\" As possible mitigation measures, users should regularly update their antivirus definitions, avoid downloading executables from unverified sources, and monitor network activity for unusual connections. Organizations can employ sandboxing to detect similar threats in a controlled environment, along with implementing application whitelisting to prevent unauthorized code execution."

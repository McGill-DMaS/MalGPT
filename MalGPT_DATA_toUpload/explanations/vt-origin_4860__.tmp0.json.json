It is detected by numerous antivirus engines, including major ones like Symantec, ESET-NOD32, and Kaspersky, as potentially unwanted or as riskware. Various signatures classify it under names such as W32.HfsAdware.DD11, Application.Generic.1646377, and Trojan.Gen.2, suggesting it is primarily an adware or potentially unwanted application with capabilities to download additional unwanted software, which might include more menacing threats. Detection statistics reveal that 52 out of 67 antivirus engines flagged the file as malicious, emphasizing the threat it poses. The file's digital signature, attributed to Code Techno, is invalid, further supporting its suspicious nature.\n\nThe file propagates through executable formats specific to Windows and leverages persistent techniques to maintain its presence on affected systems. While there are no disclosed URLs, IPs, or domain specifics, the functional attributes point towards capabilities typical for adware, such as modifying registry entries and possibly initiating unauthorized downloads. No YARA rules or specific MITRE ATT&CK techniques were indicated. Users are advised to deploy thorough endpoint protection and behavioral monitoring solutions to detect anomalies associated with such files. Strong user education, cautious downloads, and regular software updates are critical in mitigating risks. Additionally, employing robust whitelisting tools can prevent unauthorized executables from launching."

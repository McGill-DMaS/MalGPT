    "File Name": "vt-0ad266d8c5861621465f6e87c273926306d0326e16079d2e2c9b3e639f9926bc.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file in question, identified as a Windows DLL named \"scnpst64.dll,\" appears to be benign, as evidenced by its digitally signed status by Microsoft Corporation. Its description as a \"Microsoft Outlook Data File Recovery for Unicode Stores\" suggests that it is a legitimate component associated with Microsoft's software suite. Notably, the virus analysis statistics indicate that no antivirus engines flagged it as malicious, with 68 engines categorizing it as undetected. This aligns with its signed and counter-signed certificates, cementing its authenticity and reducing the likelihood of it being associated with a malware family. \n\nNo indicators of compromise, specific YARA rules, or suspicious sandbox behaviors were detected, and the file did not exhibit characteristics common to malware, such as persistence mechanisms, encryption of data, or command and control communications. Consequently, no MITRE ATT&CK tactics or relevant community discussions highlight risks associated with this file. Given its clean reputation and legitimate signing, countermeasures against this file are unnecessary. However, maintaining updated antivirus definitions and relying on reputable software sources are standard protective measures to mitigate any unlikely risks."

    "File Name": "vt-0a1501131227bbb4df15b4d3ff072f9279c22694c8526cdb26e6e9a12c2ec8e9.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file WLDCore.dll appears to be benign primarily due to the combined assessment by multiple antivirus engines, which identified it as undetected or harmless, with zero detections indicating malicious activity. This DLL is associated with Microsoft's Windows Live Client and is signed by Microsoft, providing a high level of confidence in its authenticity. The digital certificates are verified, despite being time-invalid due to expiration, further corroborating its legitimacy. Importantly, there are no identified Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), URLs, IPs, or malicious domains associated with this file, nor are there YARA rules or specific signatures that label it as malware.\n\nAnalysis of sandbox environments such as Zenbox and DAS-Security Orcas categorizes the file as harmless with clean malware classifications. No suspicious behaviors, such as persistence mechanisms, encryption activities, or command and control (C2) communications, are reported. Moreover, the file's behavior, characterized by legitimate imports like standard Windows API functions, aligns with typical operations of a system DLL rather than a malware variant. Since no malicious activities are evident and there are no community discussions suggesting otherwise, no immediate countermeasures or mitigations are needed apart from ensuring Microsoft's certificates are continuously up-to-date and valid, as a general best security practice."

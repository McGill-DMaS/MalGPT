    "File Name": "vt-origin_37108__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The submitted file appears to belong to the DownloadAdmin family, a known Potentially Unwanted Application (PUA) often flagged as adware or a downloader. Several antivirus engines, including McAfee, AVG, and Symantec, have identified it as malicious, using different names like \"SoftwareBundler:Win32/Dowadmin\" and \"Trojan.Gen.2.\" The detection rate is notably high, with 49 engines confirming its malicious nature. The file is signed with certificates indicating potential legitimacy, but the signers' certificate is not time-valid, suggesting it is not trustworthy. \n\nThe file demonstrates characteristics such as adware functionalities and may exhibit behavior consistent with downloading and installing other unwanted programs or adware without clear user consent. As a preventive measure, users should regularly update their antivirus software and avoid downloading files from untrusted sources. Possible mitigations include employing an end-user training program to recognize and avoid suspicious links, as well as utilizing network monitoring systems to detect unwanted traffic generated by such PUAs. Additional analysis through sandboxes didn't reveal associated IOCs, but enabling detailed logs on endpoint protection platforms can help in identifying and isolating the file's activities. Monitoring for MITRE ATT&CK techniques related to software bundlers or privilege escalation can be beneficial to counter potential risks posed by this file or similar threats."

    "File Name": "vt-origin_9860__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The analyzed file appears to belong to the Morstar malware family, identified as potentially unwanted software and adware. The extensive detection by numerous antivirus engines strengthens this conclusion, with labels such as \"Gen:Variant.Application.Bundler.Morstar.8,\" \"Trojan.DownLoader11.57090,\" and \"Trojan.Win32.Dwn.edhnav\" indicating its malicious nature. The file is signed by 'Investena Concept, s.l.', although its certificate is not time-valid, which raises suspicion about its authenticity.\n\nDetection statistics reveal that 45 antivirus engines have flagged this file as malicious, while only 18 have marked it as undetected. No significant URLs, IPs, or domains have been highlighted within this analysis as associated indicators of compromise (IOCs). Comprehensive sandbox analysis may reveal behaviors common to similar adware, such as persistence in the system and unsolicited downloads. As a countermeasure, users should remove this software using updated antivirus solutions and consider restricting installation of unknown executables. Mitigation strategies include employing endpoint security solutions that can detect and block potentially unwanted programs (PUPs) at the network level while ensuring systems are patched and up-to-date to avoid exploit-based attacks."

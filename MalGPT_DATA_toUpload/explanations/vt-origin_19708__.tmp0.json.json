    "File Name": "vt-origin_19708__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The analyzed file is identified as belonging to a malware family primarily associated with adware and potentially unwanted applications (PUA), such as \"W32.AIDetect.malware1,\" \"Adware.Downware.2220,\" \"Application.Bundler.KJ,\" and \"Win32:DownloadAdmin-BE [Adw],\" according to several antivirus engines, including Bkav, DrWeb, and Avast. Detection statistics indicate that 62 out of 76 antivirus engines classified the file as malicious. The file's signature verification failed due to expired certificates from \"Code Techno\" and \"VeriSign,\" indicating possible tampering or malicious intent despite bearing a code signing certificate. No associated Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) such as URLs, IPs, or domains are provided in the report, nor are there identified YARA rules, indicating a need for further forensic analysis to uncover more about its network behaviors and any command-and-control (C2) communications.\n\nBehaviorally, this malware may exhibit bundling and downloader tactics, typically involving persistence techniques like creating auto-start registry keys, and could potentially have capabilities for data exfiltration or system changes as part of its adware functionality. The lack of specific MITRE ATT&CK tactics or community discussions points to a need for deeper investigation into its execution chain and potential impact. Recommended countermeasures include implementing robust endpoint protection systems, regularly updating antivirus signatures, and educating users about avoiding similar threats. Effective mitigation strategies involve ensuring current operating system patches, employing network traffic analysis to detect anomalous behavior, and quickly isolating infected devices to prevent lateral spread."

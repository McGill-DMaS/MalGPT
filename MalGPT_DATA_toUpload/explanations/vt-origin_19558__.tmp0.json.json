According to the last analysis performed by antivirus engines, a significant majority (49 out of 63) classified it as malicious. Various engines, including Bkav, MicroWorld-eScan, Symantec, and Kaspersky, have detected this file as Application.Bundler.KJ, W32.HfsAdware.6046, Trojan.Gen.2, and not-a-virus:Downloader.Win32.DownloAdmin.gen, among similar categorizations. There were no specific associated IOCs like URLs, IPs, or domains identified directly from this file. \n\nThe report does not include specific YARA rules or detailed sandbox results such as persistence or encryption; however, the presence of DownloadAdmin-like behavior suggests a capability to download other potentially harmful software. No specific MITRE ATT&CK tactics or techniques are provided, nor community discussions are mentioned. The malware's key behaviors involve bundling unwanted software that may lead to performance degradation, privacy risks, or further malware infections. Countermeasures include implementing robust antivirus solutions, monitoring network traffic for suspicious activity, and ensuring that software installations require user confirmation. Possible mitigations include user education about the dangers of downloading and executing unverified files and maintaining up-to-date security software to detect and neutralize PUPs effectively."

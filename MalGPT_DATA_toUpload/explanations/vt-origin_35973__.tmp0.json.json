    "File Name": "vt-origin_35973__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The analyzed file is identified as belonging to the Emotet malware family, with multiple antivirus engines flagging it as malicious. Prominent engines such as ClamAV, Kaspersky, and McAfee have classified this file as a Trojan, specifically highlighting its connection to Emotet and related variants like Mint and Zard. The file has a total of 65 detections for malicious activity with no reports of suspicious or harmless classifications. The file is a PE32 executable designed for Windows systems, employing tactics commonly associated with the Emotet family such as data theft and potentially acting as a botnet component. It is identified as a trojan and banker, indicating its primary goal of harvesting sensitive information such as banking credentials.\n\nBehavioral analysis and sandbox results indicate a potential for persistence and communication with command and control (C2) servers. Specific tactics and techniques from the MITRE ATT&CK framework include Credential Access and Discovery. No specific IOCs, such as URLs or IPs, are detailed in this report. Community discussions are lacking but given Emotet's history, it is known for enabling secondary infections, such as deploying ransomware. This poses a significant risk to system integrity and data security. As countermeasures, organizations should ensure regular updates of antivirus programs and employ network-level protections to detect anomalous traffic indicative of C2 communications. Possible mitigations include user education to prevent phishing attempts that Emotet exploits to propagate and implementing application whitelisting to block unauthorized executables."

    "File Name": "vt-origin_15548__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The analyzed file, known as \"p2pgraph.dll,\" belongs to the Emotet malware family, as indicated by numerous antivirus detections. Detected by over 30 antivirus engines, including Bkav, BitDefender, and Symantec, the file exhibited various malicious behaviors aligned with the Emotet trojan. This malware type is notorious for its modular architecture, allowing it to deploy additional payloads like banking trojans or ransomware. Notably, the file was identified using blacklisting methods, showcasing high confidence in its malicious nature. The PE32 executable for Windows was disguised as a legitimate Microsoft component, exploiting familiar naming conventions to evade detection.\n\nSandbox analysis reports from engines like DAS-Security Orcas marked the file as clean, indicating no runtime behaviors were identified in their environment. However, other automated analyses confirmed malicious activity, highlighting risks such as data exfiltration, lateral movement, and potential for botnet participation. Detected techniques aligned with MITRE ATT&CK tactics, including Credential Access and Defense Evasion. Community discussions emphasize the need for heightened email filtering, user training, and endpoint protection to counteract this threat. Possible mitigations include implementing strict attachment scanning and using network threat analytics to identify abnormal communication patterns, reducing the risk of Emotet infections."

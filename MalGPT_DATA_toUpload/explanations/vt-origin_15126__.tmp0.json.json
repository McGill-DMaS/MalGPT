    "File Name": "vt-origin_15126__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The analyzed file, identified as \"Eilio_setup.exe,\" has been classified as malicious by several cybersecurity engines, with strong historic references to the \"Solimba\" and \"Morstar\" malware families. This report indicates that the file is malicious as confirmed by 61 antivirus engines identifying it as either Trojan or PUP (Potentially Unwanted Program). Notably, the detection results include specific threats such as \"W32.HfsAdware.1C2E,\" \"Trojan.DownLoader11.24441,\" and \"Gen:Variant.Application.Bundler.Morstar.30.\" Several engines like Bkav, DrWeb, MicroWorld-eScan, and Microsoft identify it as a downloader or adware, establishing a pattern of unwanted downloads and potential malicious payload delivery.\n\nThis executable, signed by \"Eilio Developments sl,\" is considered unsafe due to expired certificates, which may indicate attempts to masquerade as legitimate software. The sandbox analysis from \"Tencent HABO\" classifies it as an \"EVADER,\" suggesting possible anti-analysis techniques employed by the file to avoid detection. Community discussions lean toward categorizing this file as a risk due to its downloading behavior and system alterations. Observable tactics resemble those in MITRE ATT&CK category T1193 (Spear Phishing). As countermeasures, maintaining updated antivirus tools and employing behavior-based detection systems are crucial, along with user awareness training to mitigate potential threats. Detecting and blocking its known signatures and paths, as well as implementing strict user execution policies, can limit its impact should it breach initial defenses."

    "File Name": "vt-0aa75cbb79028cc9b0cb88f70caa716cfcac04b2aa018b0ed88a18dbb58df8b8.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file analyzed, identified as \"KernelMisc.dll,\" appears to be benign based on the available data. It was submitted for review and was detected as \"undetected\" by 71 major antivirus engines, with no engines marking it as malicious or suspicious. The file is a Win32 DLL associated with software from Tencent Technology, specifically a component for QQ2009, and is signed with a certificate, albeit one that's no longer valid. No Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) such as URLs, IPs, or domains are associated with the file. Furthermore, the sandbox verdict from DAS-Security Orcas classified it as 'harmless,' with no signs of malicious activity or behaviors like persistence, encryption, or connection to command-and-control servers.\n\nNo specific YARA rules or signatures have been identified that could categorize this file as part of a known malware family. Community discussions do not provide any relevant additional insights, and the file does not appear to align with any known tactics or techniques from the MITRE ATT&CK framework, as demonstrated during analysis. The benign status and the lack of negative detections suggest that no countermeasures or mitigations are necessary, beyond maintaining standard security practices and ensuring certificates are up-to-date, as signing certificates have been revoked or are not time valid."

    "File Name": "vt-origin_36308__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The analyzed file is associated with the \"Morstar\" malware family, frequently flagged as an adware bundler. Numerous antivirus engines, including BitDefender, Kaspersky, and Ad-Aware, detected it as \"Application.Bundler.Morstar.J,\" indicating its potential to install unwanted applications alongside legitimate software. Detection statistics reveal a significant malicious verdict with 54 antivirus engines identifying the file as threatening, while 17 remained undetected. The file's behavioral patterns suggest capabilities typical of potentially unwanted programs (PUP), potentially altering system settings or facilitating other adware installations.\n\nIn terms of Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), no specific URLs, IPs, or domains are mentioned in the report. The analysis does not highlight specific sandbox behaviors like persistence mechanisms or command-and-control communication, nor does it identify specific MITRE ATT&CK tactics. To mitigate the risks of such adware, organizations should employ robust endpoint protection solutions, maintain regular system patches, and educate users on the risks of bundled software installations. Countermeasures include ensuring network defenses are capable of inhibiting unauthorized outbound traffic and developing policies to restrict the installation of software from unverified sources."

    "File Name": "vt-origin_24802__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "Based on the analysis of the malware file, it appears to belong to the DownloadAdmin family, a type of potentially unwanted application (PUA) known for bundling with other software and often distributing adware. The file was identified as malicious by several antivirus engines, such as DrWeb, which labeled it as a \"Trojan.Vittalia,\" and Kaspersky, which identified it as \"Downloader.Win32.DownloAdmin.\" Many engines, including Microsoft, TrendMicro, and McAfee, flagged it as a variant of DownloadAdmin, indicating that this file fits the behavior of deceptive installers that can introduce additional unwanted software onto systems.\n\nThe detection statistics from antivirus engines show a significant consensus on its malicious nature, with 56 engines marking it as harmful and no benign votes. The file seems to have been signed by \"Super Click Interactive,\" but the certificate chain is time invalid, raising doubts about its legitimacy. While no specific IOCs such as URLs, IPs, or domains were explicitly associated within this report, the presence of potentially malicious aspects like bundled adware is concerning. The report lacks sandbox details, making it unclear if the malware attempts persistence, encryption, or communicates with command and control servers (C2). Mitigation strategies include removing downloaded adware applications and reinforcing endpoint security with updated AV solutions to prevent further infections. Users should exercise caution when installing software, especially those unexpectedly bundled with installers like DownloadAdmin."

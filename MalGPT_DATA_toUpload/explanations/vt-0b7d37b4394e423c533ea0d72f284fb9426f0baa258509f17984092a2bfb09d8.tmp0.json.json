    "File Name": "vt-0b7d37b4394e423c533ea0d72f284fb9426f0baa258509f17984092a2bfb09d8.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file identified as \"actcmgd.dll\" appears to be benign based on the comprehensive analysis from multiple antivirus engines, with none detecting it as malicious. The file is associated with Autodesk's AutoCAD product, which is confirmed by the signature information and the file description. The digital signature, although belonging to a trusted publisher, is noted as not within its validity period, indicating a potential signing issue, but not necessarily malicious intent.\n\nDetection statistics show 0 out of 56 antivirus engines flagging the file, suggesting widespread recognition as non-malicious software. The sandbox analysis from DAS-Security Orcas indicates a \"harmless\" verdict with no malicious behavior such as persistence or communication with command-and-control servers. No indicators of compromise, such as suspicious URLs or IPs, are associated with this file, nor are any YARA rules or specific MITRE ATT&CK techniques applicable here. Given the benign status, no specific countermeasures or mitigations are necessary, though it would be prudent to ensure file signatures are current and valid in a system security context."

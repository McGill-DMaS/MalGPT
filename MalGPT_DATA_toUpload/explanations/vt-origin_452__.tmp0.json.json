    "File Name": "vt-origin_452__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The analyzed file is identified as part of the \"DownloadAdmin\" and \"Application.Bundler\" malware families, with several antivirus engines, such as Kaspersky, Symantec, and Microsoft, marking it as malicious or potentially unwanted software (PUA). Malware analysis indicates a significant presence of malicious classifications (61 out of 70 engines flagged it as harmful), suggesting a consensus on its malicious nature. The malicious tags associate the file with adware and potential riskware characteristics, primarily designed to deliver unwanted software and engage in questionable advertisement activities.\n\nThe file is a Windows executable (type tag: peexe) with attributes indicating outdated or invalid certificates, used for signing, which highlights an attempt to bypass security checks. Despite its first detection in 2015, this outdated file retains the ability to surprise users due to its interaction with several Windows libraries (e.g., kernel32.dll, user32.dll), potentially altering system settings or files in stealthy manners, typical of adware and lightweight Trojans. Countermeasures include using up-to-date antivirus solutions, restricting unnecessary software installations, and employing application control techniques. Possible mitigations involve regularly verifying the validity of software certificates and avoiding execution of unsigned or improperly signed files to thwart such adware infections."

    "File Name": "vt-origin_2356__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file analyzed appears to be associated with the Andromeda malware family, a common backdoor Trojan used for malicious activities such as data theft and further infection with other malware. Multiple antivirus engines, including MicroWorld-eScan, Kaspersky, and TrendMicro, have flagged this file as malicious, specifically identifying it as a variant of the Andromeda backdoor. Detection statistics indicate that 52 engines marked the file as malicious, with no engines labeling it as harmless. Importantly, Andromeda is often associated with command and control (C2) activities and can be leveraged for persistent access on infected systems.\n\nWhile the file lacks clear Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) such as URLs or IP addresses within this report, its characteristics, such as the import of functions from dynamic link libraries (e.g., KERNEL32.dll), suggest potential malicious activities like resource manipulation and system information retrieval. The file is not reported to have matched any specific YARA rules in this submission. Sandbox results and community discussions specific to this instance are not detailed, limiting additional insights into its behavior and associated risks. Mitigation should focus on updating antivirus solutions regularly, monitoring suspicious network activity, and employing endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to catch any malicious behavior that may not be detected initially by traditional antivirus software. Countermeasures also include educating users on recognizing phishing attempts, which are common vectors for Andromeda distribution."

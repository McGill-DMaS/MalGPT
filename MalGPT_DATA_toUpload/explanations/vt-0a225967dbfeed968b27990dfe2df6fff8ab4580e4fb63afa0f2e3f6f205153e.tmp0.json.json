    "Explanation": "Based on the file details provided, the Transcode.dll file appears to be benign as it was classified as 'CLEAN' by the DAS-Security Orcas sandbox. Notably, the file is digitally signed by Youku.com Inc., and no antivirus engines detected it as malicious; it remains 'undetected' according to 69 different antivirus engines. Additionally, all associated certificates, although some are now time-invalid, suggest legitimate code signing, and no suspicious Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) like URLs, IP addresses, or domains have been linked to this DLL. \n\nFurthermore, there are no identified YARA rules, community discussions indicating nefarious behavior, or noteworthy behaviors suggesting risks such as persistence or communication with command and control (C2) servers. Therefore, typical countermeasures such as maintaining up-to-date antivirus and ensuring proper certificate validation for future software installations have been observed. Possible mitigation in case of future suspicion includes hashing and reputation checks via trusted security platforms and monitoring any abnormal system behavior when this DLL is in use."

    "File Name": "vt-0b4f2d1bdde45e2c9638c46759f72af28b791aa2a2151c5fd2d414a5edbc1882.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file \"KSound.dll\" appears benign based on the analysis, as it is undetected by 71 antivirus engines including those from leading security vendors such as Kaspersky, McAfee, and Microsoft. It carries tags such as \"invalid-signature\" and \"revoked-cert,\" indicating potential issues with its digital certificate, but these do not inherently imply malicious intent. The absence of detection results from antivirus scans corroborates the benign status of this file. The file is signed by Zhuhai Kingsoft Software Co., Ltd., albeit with an expired and revoked certificate, which appears to be a common issue with older software.\n\nThere is no match with any known malware families, and no indicators of compromise (IOCs) such as command and control (C2) communication are noted. No YARA rules or specific signatures have been identified that associate this file with malicious behavior. The detailed analysis of the file\u2019s PE structure and imports, such as those from \"KERNEL32.dll\" and \"MSVCR80.dll,\" highly resemble ordinary Windows DLL files. In the absence of documented risks or behaviors signaling malicious activity in sandbox environments, no specific MITRE ATT&CK techniques can be attributed to this file. Community discussions around this file are also absent, suggesting that it is not flagged for concern. As a measure of precaution, ensuring system certificates and operating system files are updated would mitigate potential risks tied to using unsigned or outdated components."

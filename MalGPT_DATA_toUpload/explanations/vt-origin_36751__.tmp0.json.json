    "File Name": "vt-origin_36751__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The analyzed file appears to be malicious with various antivirus engines identifying it as part of the DownloadAdmin family, specifically as adware or potentially unwanted applications (PUAs). Notable engines like Symantec, Kaspersky, and AVG identified it as Trojan.Gen.2, not-a-virus:Downloader.Win32.DownloAdmin.gen, and Win32:DownloadAdmin-BE [Adw] respectively, emphasising its potential risk. The detection statistics indicate 52 engines flagged the file as malicious, with no reports of it being harmless, indicating strong consensus on its malicious nature. The file is a Win32 executable, signed but with an invalid certificate, indicating possible attempts at masquerading legitimacy.\n\nDespite no specific IOCs such as URLs or IPs being mentioned, the presence of suspicious imports and functions related to system functions from libraries like KERNEL32 and ADVAPI32 suggests capabilities for file operations and registry modifications, common in adware behavior. This malware has been submitted multiple times, suggesting persistence, with community discussions likely focusing on its distribution via bundling or deceptive downloads. Mitigation measures could include using up-to-date antivirus protection, careful scrutiny of downloaded files, and education on avoiding PUA-ridden software. Employing web filters and endpoint detection systems is a viable countermeasure, and isolating affected systems would prevent further proliferation."

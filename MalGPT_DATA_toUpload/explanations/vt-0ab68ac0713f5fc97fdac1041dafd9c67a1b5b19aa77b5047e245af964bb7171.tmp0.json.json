All antivirus engines listed, including prominent ones like McAfee, Symantec, and Kaspersky, have categorized it as undetected, resulting in no detection of malicious activity. The signed certificate from Microsoft Corporation further suggests its authenticity, decreasing the likelihood of it being associated with a malware family. Additionally, sandbox analysis categorizes this file as 'clean,' indicating no harmful behavior during dynamic analysis. As a result, there are no identified Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), YARA rules, or specific behaviors that associate this file with malicious activities.\n\nDespite the benign status, standard countermeasures should continue to be applied to safeguard systems against potential risks, which include maintaining updated antivirus signatures and employing network monitoring for anomalous activities. While no direct MITRE ATT&CK tactics or techniques have been identified, vigilance is recommended. Continuously educate users on identifying phishing and social engineering tactics, which are common methods for delivering malware. Overall, the file poses minimal risk based on current evidence, but staying updated with security best practices remains crucial."

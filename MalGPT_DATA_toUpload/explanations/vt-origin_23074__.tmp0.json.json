    "File Name": "vt-origin_23074__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The analyzed file is identified as malicious, falling under the malware category commonly associated with potentially unwanted applications (PUA) and adware. Multiple antivirus engines, such as McAfee, Kaspersky, Symantec, and Microsoft, have flagged it as malicious, with common detections mentioning \"DownloadAdmin\" or \"Adware.\" Specifically, 49 antivirus engines have marked this file as malicious, affirming its threat level. The file includes signatures related to adware components and exhibits features found in downloader-type malware, which often bundled additional unwanted software upon execution.\n\nThe primary behavior exhibited includes downloading additional payloads, as suggested by its classification by Kaspersky as \"Downloader.Win32.DownloAdmin.gen.\" Despite its verified signature issued by \"Code Techno,\" the certificate is deemed invalid due to its expiry. The file imports functions from various DLLs indicating capabilities such as registry manipulation (via ADVAPI32.dll) and process creation (via KERNEL32.dll), potentially enabling persistence and execution of other malicious programs. Typical mitigation strategies include restricting the execution of unknown executables through application whitelisting, using advanced endpoint protection, and educating users on the risks of PUA and adware. Regular updates of antivirus definitions and user vigilance form essential lines of defense against such threats."

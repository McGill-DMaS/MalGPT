    "File Name": "vt-origin_37316__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The analyzed file appears to be associated with the \"Morstar\" family of potentially unwanted applications (PUA) or adware, which is known for bundling software with additional, often unwanted, components. This identification is corroborated by multiple antivirus engines, with notable detections including Bkav classifying it as \"W32.HfsAdware.689E\" and BitDefender detecting it as \"Gen:Variant.Application.Bundler.Morstar.8\". Out of the 67 antivirus engines that assessed the file, 50 labeled it as malicious. \n\nAlthough no IP addresses, URLs, or domains are explicitly associated within the report, the application signatures suggest a primary focus on downloading and installing unwanted components. These behaviors align with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Execution (T1203), where the malware might execute via user execution through deceptive installations. Key risks include potential system slowdown, privacy invasion, or unwanted advertisements. Suggested countermeasures include updating antivirus definitions and ensuring software is downloaded only from trusted sources. Employing endpoint security solutions can further mitigate the risk by blocking or flagging similar unwanted applications."

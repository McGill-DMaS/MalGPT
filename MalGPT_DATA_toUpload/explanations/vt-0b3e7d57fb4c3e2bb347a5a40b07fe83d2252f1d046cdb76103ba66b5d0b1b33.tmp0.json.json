    "File Name": "vt-0b3e7d57fb4c3e2bb347a5a40b07fe83d2252f1d046cdb76103ba66b5d0b1b33.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file analyzed, identified as 'sqoras32.dll', appears largely benign based on the VirusTotal analysis, where 71 antivirus engines detected no malicious activity, with only one engine, APEX, marking it as 'Malicious'. It is primarily identified as a PE32+ executable (DLL) for Windows, categorized under the 'executable', 'windows', 'win32', and 'pe' tags, indicative of a standard dynamic link library file. Its historical use as an Oracle ODBC driver further suggests legitimacy. There are no additional indicators of compromise (IOCs), YARA rules, or community discussions suggesting a malware family association, reflecting a typical profile for a trusted file.\n\nThe sandbox analysis corroborates this benign assessment, with the DAS-Security Orcas sandbox marking the file as 'clean'. No suspicious network activity, persistence, or encryption behavior is noted, and there are no associated MITRE ATT&CK tactics or techniques. The report indicates no need for immediate countermeasures or mitigation, though standard security hygiene, such as ensuring all software and dependencies are up to date and verifying the origins and hashes of files, is recommended. This approach minimizes residual risks, even as the singular detection by APEX warrants continued monitoring."

    "File Name": "vt-origin_30241__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The analyzed file, identified as \"ZNFWAXSO.exe,\" is classified under the malware family \"DownloadAdmin.\" It predominantly appears to function as Potentially Unwanted Application (PUA) and adware, with multiple antivirus engines such as BitDefender, F-Secure, and Microsoft tagging it as an 'Application.Generic' or 'SoftwareBundler,' besides specific detections like 'W32.HfsAdware.DD11' and 'PUP.Codetechno.Gen' by Bkav and QuickHeal respectively. Detection statistics reveal that out of the engines used, 48 classify this file as malicious, with others either detecting or remaining undetectable potentially due to unsupported types.\n\nThe file's behavior is consistent with that of a downloader, capable of executing potentially unwanted software without user intervention, conceivably through the exploitation of certain Windows API calls for file manipulation and process creation, as evidenced by the analysis of the imports list. A significant feature lies in the code signing certificate from \"Code Techno,\" which is flagged as outdated, casting further suspicion on its authenticity. The file does not explicitly appear to leverage sandbox-evasive techniques like advanced persistence or encryption for communication, nor are network IOCs such as C2 domains apparent in submitted information.\n\nTo counteract the risks posed by such files, entities should employ robust application whitelisting policies, ensuring only signed and verified applications with valid certificates are executed. As a mitigation strategy, an updated antivirus solution capable of recognizing PUAs and similar threats from the DownloadAdmin family should be utilized. Additionally, educating users on the risks of downloading software from unofficial sources can help mitigate exposure to such threats. Finally, regular audits of executables stored within the environment for time validity of their certificates and analysis of their behaviors can further reduce potential vulnerabilities exploitation."

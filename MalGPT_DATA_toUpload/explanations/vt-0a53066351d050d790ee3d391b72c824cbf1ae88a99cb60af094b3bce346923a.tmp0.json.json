    "File Name": "vt-0a53066351d050d790ee3d391b72c824cbf1ae88a99cb60af094b3bce346923a.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file in question appears to be benign, as indicated by its detection statistics: no antivirus engines detected it as malicious. The file type is identified as a 'Win32 Dynamic Link Library (DLL)' and it seems to serve as a legitimate component, namely the 'ICFunc Dynamic Link Library' from its metadata. It has been scanned by multiple major antivirus engines such as Symantec, McAfee, and Kaspersky, among others, all of which have ruled it as undetected, suggesting it is likely a non-malicious file. This is further supported by the sandbox analysis from DAS-Security Orcas which classified the sample as \"harmless,\" and no behavioral or persistence characteristics typically associated with malware were noted.\n\nDespite the clean detection results, there are no associated indicators of compromise (IOCs) such as URLs or domains, and no YARA rules or signatures have been triggered. The lack of any MITRE ATT&CK tactics or techniques implies that the file does not exhibit behaviors associated with known cyber threats. Community discussions or contributions were not noted, which may align with its benign status. As a preventative measure, regularly updating antivirus definitions and employing a robust security policy would mitigate the risk of inadvertently executing any potentially harmful files that may arise. Additionally, verifying the source of DLL files and monitoring system changes could help ensure their integrity and legitimacy."

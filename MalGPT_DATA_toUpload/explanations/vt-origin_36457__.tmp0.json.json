    "File Name": "vt-origin_36457__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The analyzed file is identified as a member of the \"DownloadAdmin\" malware family, which is frequently associated with unwanted software bundling and potentially unwanted applications (PUAs). This assessment is supported by the detection results from numerous antivirus engines, with 49 engines marking it as malicious. Labels from these engines include \"Application.Bundler.KJ,\" \"Win32:DownloadAdmin-BE [Adw],\" and \"Riskware/DownloadAdmin,\" among others. The file is detected due to its adware-related behaviors, manifesting as pop-up ads and potentially altering browser settings without user consent. Despite some legitimate certificates from VeriSign, the certificate used by this file has expired, further raising suspicion about its legitimacy.\n\nIn the context of threat indicators, there are no explicit IOCs, URLs, IPs, or domains associated with this sample. However, the sample's behavior is confirmed by many antivirus engines as risky due to its PUA nature. No specific sandbox behaviors, such as persistence or C2 communications, have been noted, nor are there identified YARA rules or a MITRE ATT&CK mapping. Community discussions appear to side with caution, labeling the file as risky. To mitigate risks, one should avoid downloading software from untrusted sources, utilize endpoint protection solutions to prevent unwanted installations, and regularly update security patches. If the file has been executed, it's advisable to conduct system scans, remove associated adware, and potentially restore browser settings to default to prevent further unwanted actions."

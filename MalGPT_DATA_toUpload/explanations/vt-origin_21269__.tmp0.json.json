The file has been detected as malicious by 61 antivirus engines and is classified as a trojan, with common detection names including \"Trojan.Win32.Emotet\" and \"Trojan.Agent.CXCP\". Emotet is known for its capabilities in spreading via spam emails, stealing sensitive information, and deploying additional payloads. The file is tagged with features indicating it includes spreader functionality, direct CPU clock access, and runtime modules, which align with the typical behavior of Emotet.\n\nAccording to VirusTotal's last analysis results, the file maintains a high confidence rating for maliciousness. The file exhibits numerous suspicious behaviors, such as persistence mechanisms, likely encryption, and potential command-and-control (C2) communication. There is no specific mention of YARA rules or detailed sandbox results in the given data. To mitigate the risks posed by Emotet, organizations and individuals should implement measures such as robust email filtering, endpoint protection solutions, regular software updates, user education on phishing scams, and network segmentation to limit lateral movement. Additionally, employing intrusion detection systems to flag anomalous behavior and restricting macros in Office documents can further help in containment and prevention."

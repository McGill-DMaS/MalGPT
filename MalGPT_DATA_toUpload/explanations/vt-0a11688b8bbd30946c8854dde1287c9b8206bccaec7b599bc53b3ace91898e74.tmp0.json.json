    "File Name": "vt-0a11688b8bbd30946c8854dde1287c9b8206bccaec7b599bc53b3ace91898e74.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The analyzed file, *memvfile.dll*, appears to be benign, based on a comprehensive evaluation across multiple antivirus engines, all of which did not detect any malicious activity. Specifically, 69 engines classified the file as undetected, with none marking it as suspicious or malicious. The file is reportedly linked to anti-malware protection, identified as a component developed by Panda Security, as per the signing details. Despite having certificates that are presently non-time-valid and potentially revoked, the item functions as an anti-malware access library, which further supports its benign nature.\n\nRegarding indicators of compromise (IOCs), there are no malicious URLs, IPs, or domains associated with this file, and no YARA rules or specific malware signatures were associated. Sandbox results, including those from DAS-Security Orcas, marked the file as clean with no indicators of malicious behavior such as persistence mechanisms, encryption, or command and control (C2) communication. Community discussions and analyses do not raise concerns, pointing instead to mitigations by ensuring robust certificate validation processes and monitoring for certificate expirations or anomalies. To mitigate risks associated with potentially tampered files, users should regularly update their security software and ensure strict verification of all digital certificates, particularly those from third-party vendors."

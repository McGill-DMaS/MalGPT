    "Explanation": "The file in question appears to be benign because all antivirus engines have reported it as undetected, as seen in the last analysis results, which include a wide range of engines like BitDefender, Kaspersky, and Microsoft. Furthermore, DAS-Security Orcas sandbox classified it as 'harmless,' supporting the benign status. The file is a signed Windows DLL associated with Microsoft SQL Server and bears a valid signature from Microsoft Corporation, further indicating its legitimacy. There are no Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) such as URLs, IPs, or domains associated with the file.\n\nNo YARA rules or signatures were identified, and there were no sandbox findings indicative of malicious behaviors such as persistence mechanisms, encryption, or communication with command and control servers. As a result, there are no applicable MITRE ATT&CK tactics or techniques related to this file. Community discussions also suggest no concerns regarding its safety. As a precaution, maintaining up-to-date antivirus software and regular system monitoring is advised for mitigating potential risk, although the identified file does not pose any evident threat."

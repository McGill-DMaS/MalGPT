    "File Name": "vt-0c170425253a930ce053f9369f373b54cf4cb7e8bbea9f1a36db908d520defed.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The analyzed file appears to be benign. According to VirusTotal, none of the 73 antivirus engines detected the file as malicious, and all categorized it as undetected or type-unsupported. This suggests that the file does not contain known malware signatures. The file is a PE32 DLL, with a compiler and linker metadata indicating it was developed using Microsoft Visual C/C++ between 2008 and 2010. It features export functions typical of a video encoding library, such as \"OVEncodeCreateSession\" and \"OVDecodePicture,\" which aligns with its tag 'pedll,' categorizing it as a DLL likely used for video processing rather than malicious intent.\n\nNo meaningful Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) like URLs, IPs, or domains are associated with the file, as all engines returned no detection results. The sandbox verdicts also confirm the harmless nature of this file, with DAS-Security Orcas marking it as \"CLEAN.\" There are no relevant community discussions or identified YARA rules suggesting malicious behavior or association with MITRE ATT&CK tactics. As a measure of precaution, one should monitor for any unusual behavior during execution, keep the system patched with the latest security updates, and maintain regular system backups. No further mitigation is necessary given the current analysis."

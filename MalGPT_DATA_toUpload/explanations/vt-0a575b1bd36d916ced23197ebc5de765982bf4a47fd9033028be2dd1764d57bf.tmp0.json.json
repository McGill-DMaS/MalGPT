    "Explanation": "The analyzed file, aagmmc.dll, appears to be benign. This deduction is supported by several key factors: firstly, all antivirus engines that assessed the file categorized it as \"undetected,\" meaning they did not identify any malicious characteristics. Additionally, DAS-Security Orcas, a security sandbox, classified the file as \"harmless\" and determined there is no malware activity associated with the DLL. The file is signed by Microsoft Corporation, a trusted entity, further reinforcing its goodware status. Moreover, it is distributed by and attributed to Microsoft products. These combined elements suggest the file is a legitimate component of the Microsoft Windows operating system.\n\nIn terms of antivirus detection, all 71 engines reported the file as undetected, underscoring its benign nature. There are no associated Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) such as URLs, IPs, or domains, and no YARA rules or security signatures were triggered. Sandbox analysis showed no signs of persistence mechanisms, encryption usage, or Command and Control (C2) communications. The file is well-grounded within typical operational processes of the Windows OS and does not align with any MITRE ATT&CK tactics or techniques. As it poses no risk, no immediate countermeasures or mitigation steps are necessary. Regular system maintenance and updates remain proactive practices to ensure overall system security."

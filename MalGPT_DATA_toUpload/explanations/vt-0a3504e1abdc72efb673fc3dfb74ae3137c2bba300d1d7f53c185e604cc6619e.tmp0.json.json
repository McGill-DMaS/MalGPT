    "Explanation": "The file \"WSCTool.exe\" appears to be benign based on the provided analysis. Throughout its examination by various antivirus engines, it universally remains undetected as malicious by all reported engines, including Symantec, Microsoft, and Kaspersky, among others. Additionally, there are zero malicious votes from community submissions, and the sandbox analysis by Zenbox categorizes it as harmless. This, coupled with its robust digital signature verified by entities such as Trend Micro and VeriSign, suggests a legitimate software entity rather than malware. However, a notable aspect is that several certificates in the chain were reported expired or explicitly distrusted, possibly raising concerns if being assessed in an environment where certificate validity is a strict requirement.\n\nDespite the lack of malicious intent attributed to this executable, users should exercise standard caution when operating executable files that involve system management capabilities. Monitoring for suspicious network activity through firewall and network security tools, maintaining updated antivirus signatures, and enforcing proper digital certificate checks could be prudent actions. Establishing a regular update schedule and ensuring that executables sourced from the internet are vetted through secure channels are recommended mitigations to maintain a safe operational posture."

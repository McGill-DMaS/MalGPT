    "Explanation": "The file in question appears to be a benign DLL known for serving as a component of the Microsoft\u00ae Windows\u00ae Operating System, specifically the Media Foundation Media Engine DLL. This is corroborated by the trusted verdict from Microsoft Corporation, labeling it as \"goodware.\" The analysis statistics further support this benign diagnosis, with only one detection flagged as malicious by APEX, whereas all other antivirus engines categorized it as undetected or validated its legitimacy. Consequently, the likelihood of it being malicious is negligible. \n\nSeveral indicators pertinent to malware identification are notably absent in this case, such as malicious URLs, IP addresses, or domains typically associated with harmful software actions. The sandbox analysis did not reveal malevolent activities such as persistence mechanisms, encryption efforts, or command-and-control communications. Furthermore, there are no identified YARA rules, specific signatures, or associated MITRE ATT&CK tactics linked with this file. Given its clean bill of health, continuous monitoring for updates from reliable security vendors and maintaining up-to-date security patches and software checks constitute effective countermeasures to safeguard systems."

The detailed analysis by 56 different antivirus engines shows that the file was primarily categorized as \"undetected,\" with no engines flagging it as malicious or suspicious. Furthermore, the file's reputation score is neutral, with no votes indicating malicious intent. Sandbox results, such as those from DAS-Security Orcas, classified the file as \"harmless,\" further supporting the non-malicious nature of this DLL file. Additionally, the file is signed by a legitimate certificate issued to Online Media Technologies Ltd., though the certificate is noted to be not time-valid.\n\nThe presence of tags like \"pedll,\" \"signed,\" and \"overlay,\" along with its classification as a \"DirectShow filter,\" suggests its legitimate use in media-related applications. There are no indicators of compromise, such as URLs, IPs, or domains associated with malicious activity, and the static analysis reveals standard DLL-related exports and imports with no unusual characteristics. No YARA rules or MITRE ATT&CK techniques are identified, indicating a lack of suspicious behavior or known attack patterns. For organizations using this DLL, maintaining updated antivirus definitions and regular security audits can be considered adequate countermeasures to mitigate risks. Continued vigilance for certificate validation remains a crucial part of ensuring the genuineness of similar signed files."

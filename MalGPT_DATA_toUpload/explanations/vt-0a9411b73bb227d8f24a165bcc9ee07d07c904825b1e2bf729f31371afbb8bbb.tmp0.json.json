    "File Name": "vt-0a9411b73bb227d8f24a165bcc9ee07d07c904825b1e2bf729f31371afbb8bbb.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file in question appears to be benign. Analysis across multiple antivirus engines indicates that the file has not been detected as malicious, with 0 out of 65 engines marking it as harmful or suspicious. Additionally, the DAS-Security Orcas sandbox conclusion categorizes the file as harmless. The file is associated with the Microsoft SQL Server product, specifically \"Microsoft.Data.DataFeedClient.dll,\" which is further verified by a valid digital signature from Microsoft Corporation. These attributes lend credibility to the file's authenticity and benign nature.\n\nThe file's metadata suggests it is a PE32 executable for Windows (DLL), with tags such as \"assembly,\" \"pedll,\" and \"signed,\" indicating it is a dynamically linked library with known distribution from Microsoft. There are no indicators of compromise, such as URLs, IPs, or domains, nor any YARA rules that flag concerning behaviors. Consequently, no specific MITRE ATT&CK tactics or techniques are applicable, and community discussions corroborate its benign classification. The key measures for assurance would involve ensuring the file is obtained from legitimate sources, paired with regular system and security software updates for mitigation against potential future exploits."

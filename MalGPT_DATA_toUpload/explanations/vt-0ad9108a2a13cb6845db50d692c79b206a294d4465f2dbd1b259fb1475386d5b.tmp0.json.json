    "File Name": "vt-0ad9108a2a13cb6845db50d692c79b206a294d4465f2dbd1b259fb1475386d5b.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file analyzed is identified as \"Plugin.dll\" and appears to be benign. The reason for this assessment is that it is signed by Adobe Systems Incorporated, albeit with a certificate that has been revoked. The file claims to be related to Adobe Photoshop CS6's plugin utilities and is signed by a reputable entity, which suggests it is legitimate software. Additionally, 68 antivirus engines have scanned the file, and only one (VBA32) identified it as potentially malicious (category: SigCompromised.AdobeSystemsIncorporated), while the rest categorized it as undetected or harmless.\n\nThe detection statistics from antivirus engines are predominantly clean, indicating no significant threats. There are no identified Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) such as URLs, IPs, or domains associated with this file. Furthermore, there are no YARA rules or specific signatures linked to this file. Sandbox results label the file as harmless, and there are no documented behaviors per MITRE ATT&CK tactics or techniques. Community discussions are not presented, which aligns with the file's benign assessment. As a precautionary measure, ensuring the software's source is trusted and verifying signatures before execution can mitigate risks. Regular updates to security software can provide additional protection against potential threats hidden in revoked certificates."

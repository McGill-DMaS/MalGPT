    "File Name": "vt-0a722a44f431cab5ea77ff5f25eb6975c2111b605564ff9fb59751067e7cd3a7.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file analyzed, identified as \"umpo.dll,\" is confirmed to be benign. This DLL, a component of the Microsoft Windows Operating System, serves as a User-mode Power Service. The attributes from known distributors like Microsoft and Symantec, and its classification by Microsoft Corporation as \"goodware,\" affirm its legitimate status. VirusTotal's analysis indicates 68 engines scanned the file without marking it as malicious or suspicious, solidifying its harmless nature in the assessment.\n\nGiven its legitimate nature, no indicators of compromise (IOCs) such as URLs, IPs, or domains, were noted. There were also no matches to YARA rules or malicious signatures. Sandbox environments categorized the file clean and harmless with no behaviors typical of malware activities, such as persistence mechanisms or command-and-control (C2) communications. Consequently, no MITRE ATT&CK tactics or techniques, specific community discussions around malignancy, key risks, or behaviors associated with malware, are relevant to this file. As a result, common cybersecurity countermeasures or mitigations for malware are not applicable here, as the DLL functions as designed within the Windows platform."

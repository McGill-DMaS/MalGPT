    "File Name": "vt-origin_11161__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The analyzed file, identified as \"Dubstar.exe,\" belongs to the Androm/Loki malware family, which combines trojan and ransomware attributes. Detected by 61 antivirus engines, it is confirmed malicious, with identifiers highlighting threats such as \"Trojan.Win32.Androm\" and \"Gen:Variant.Ransom.Loki.21143.\" This malware is recognized for its capability to inject code and create backdoors, suggesting potential data theft or system compromise. Common indicators of compromise (IOCs) include those related to Androm trojans and Loki variants, focusing on callouts to C2 servers for remote command execution.\n\nIn terms of its behavior, the malware exhibits packing (\"Packed-FBQ\") and runtime module loading indicative of persistence strategies. With no explicit YARA rules identified in the report, community discussions emphasize the file's risk due to its embedding techniques, self-propagation via spreading capabilities, and potential encryption activities. The use of Visual Basic 6.0 for compiling suggests evasion tactics typical to legacy systems. Potential countermeasures include deploying endpoint protection solutions capable of identifying anomalies in runtime behavior, application whitelisting to block unauthorized execution, and conducting routine threat intelligence updates to detect emerging variations. Organizations should ensure robust backup solutions and enforce network segmentation to mitigate impacts from such infections."

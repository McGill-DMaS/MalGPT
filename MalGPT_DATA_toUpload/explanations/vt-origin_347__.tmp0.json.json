    "File Name": "vt-origin_347__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The analyzed file, identified as \"Centrosome5.exe,\" belongs to the malware family predominantly classified as a Trojan, particularly linked to the \"Androm\" and \"Loki\" variants. The file is a Windows PE executable, compiled using Microsoft Visual Basic 6. Detection statistics indicate that 60 antivirus engines classify this file as malicious, with various detections noted for Trojan.Androm and Gen:Variant.Ransom.Loki among others. Despite some engines failing or having type-unsupported categories, the consensus reflects malicious intent due to the presence of backdoors and trojan functions. The presence of imports from the MSVBVM60.DLL library underscores the use of Visual Basic functions, which are often leveraged by such malware for malicious activities.\n\nNo specific Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) such as URLs, IPs, or domains are detailed in the provided information. However, sandbox verdicts from SecneurX deem it harmless, in contrast to numerous antivirus engines labeling it as malicious, suggesting potential evasion or error in automated sandbox analysis. The key behaviors and risks associated with this malware include data exfiltration and unauthorized remote access through backdoor channels. The community discussions and threat classifications align with the MITRE ATT&CK framework's tactics of Execution (T1204), Persistence (T1547), and Command and Control (T1568). To mitigate the risks posed by this malware, it is crucial to employ comprehensive endpoint protection solutions, regularly update software defenses, enforce application whitelisting, and educate users on identifying phishing attempts that may lead to its execution. Additionally, conducting regular threat hunting exercises to detect potential infiltrations early can be effective."

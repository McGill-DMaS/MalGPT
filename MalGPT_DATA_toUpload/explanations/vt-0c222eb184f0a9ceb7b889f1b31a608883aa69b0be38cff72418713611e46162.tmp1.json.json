    "Explanation": "The file in question could not be analyzed due to a \"NotFoundError,\" indicating that it was not found in the database. Consequently, there is no available information or detection statistics from antivirus engines regarding its classification. Since it was not found, it cannot be conclusively linked to any known malware family or benign category. Without detection, there are no associated Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), identified YARA rules, sandbox analysis results, or community discussions available for this file.\n\nDue to the lack of information, it is impossible to summarize the key behaviors, risks, or suggest specific countermeasures and mitigations. To proceed, it may be beneficial to verify the hash value for accuracy or to rescan with the latest virus definitions. Establishing proper file provenance and operational security measures, such as network segmentation and regular updates, remains critical even in the absence of specific threats, ensuring that systems are safeguarded against unidentified or emerging threats."

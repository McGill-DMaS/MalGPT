    "File Name": "vt-origin_7115__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The analyzed file is associated with the Emotet malware family, which is a well-known and sophisticated banking Trojan typically spread via phishing emails. Detected by numerous antivirus engines as Emotet or its variants, the file exhibits traits representative of Emotet malware, such as being flagged as a Trojan by engines such as McAfee, Microsoft, and TrendMicro. Out of 60 engines, 60 categorized it as malicious, while 12 reported it as undetected. Significant indicators of compromise (IOCs) include communication attempts to the IP 164.132.223.193 at port 8080 and HTTP requests by IPv4 address. YARA rules identified unusual connections to uncommon ports and modifications to registry settings, which are indicative of malicious intent, persistence, and potential data exfiltration or command-and-control (C2) communications.\n\nThe sandbox analysis identifies potential behaviors such as employing obfuscation techniques and connections to C2 servers, augmenting Emotet\u2019s capability to distribute additional payloads or steal credentials. MITRE ATT&CK tactics potentially involved include initial access through phishing, execution of malicious executable files, and persistence through registry modification under the tactic of registry run keys or startup folder. Effective countermeasures include implementing advanced email filters, regularly updating antivirus signatures, and ensuring network defense mechanisms are adept at detecting and blocking outbound C2 traffic. Mitigation strategies may involve educating users on phishing attack recognition, employing multi-factor authentication, and ensuring robust incident response plans to quickly isolate infected systems."

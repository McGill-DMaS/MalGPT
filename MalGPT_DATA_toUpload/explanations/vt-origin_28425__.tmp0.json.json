    "File Name": "vt-origin_28425__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file in question is identified as malicious and falls under various malware categories based on antivirus engine detections. It has been flagged primarily as adware and potentially unwanted software (PUP), with specific detections labeling it as variants like Win32:DownloadAdmin, Adware.BrowseFoxCRT, and Trojan.Gen.2, among others. The detection statistics are significant, with 49 engines identifying it as malicious, while several others either categorized it as undetected or flagged it under unsupported methods. The signature information indicates invalid or expired certificates linked to a signer named \"Code Techno,\" suggesting potential foul play or misuse of legitimate code-signing credentials.\n\nKey behaviors and risks associated with this malware include the capability to download additional components, exhibit adware characteristics, and potentially manipulate system configurations, as indicated by the use of system functions and libraries like KERNEL32.dll and ADVAPI32.dll for operations such as file management and registry modifications. There were no specific IOCs, YARA rules, MITRE ATT&CK tactics, sandbox results, or community discussions detailed in the report. Countermeasures include employing robust antivirus solutions capable of identifying and mitigating such adware and PUP threats, ensuring software and signatures are regularly updated, and avoiding the installation of software from untrusted sources. Possible mitigations involve restricting permissions, monitoring system changes, and maintaining careful scrutiny over software certificates and signing authorities."

    "File Name": "vt-origin_9052__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The analyzed malware file is detected by several antivirus engines as being associated with the DownloadAdmin family, specifically flagged for containing adware and potentially unwanted programs (PUA). Engines such as McAfee, Symantec, Kaspersky, and Microsoft categorize this file as malicious, identifying it as Win32 adware or downloader, with some engines specifically mentioning names like \"W32.HfsAdware.DD11\", \"Trojan.Gen.2\", and \"SoftwareBundler:Win32/Dowadmin\". The file was signed by an entity known as \"Code Techno\" but one of the certificates is not time-valid, raising suspicions regarding its authenticity. A total of 47 engines have marked the file as malicious, highlighting its risky nature in potentially installing unwanted or harmful software without user consent.\n\nIn terms of behavior, the malware employs multiple system calls and imports from libraries like KERNEL32.dll and ADVAPI32.dll, indicative of capabilities to manipulate system files and registry settings, which aligns with downloaders that install additional programs. The file lacks explicit Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) such as URLs, IPs, or domains in this report, nor does it provide identified YARA rules or specific MITRE ATT&CK tactics used. However, the possible risk of this malware includes system slowdown or compromised security through software bundling. Countermeasures include the use of endpoint protection software to prevent execution and conducting regular scans to detect and remove PUA/Adware. As mitigation, users should ensure that certificates are always valid and avoid downloading software from untrusted sources to protect against similar threats. Further isolation and monitoring should be conducted on suspect executable files in a secure sandbox environment prior to permitting network access."

    "File Name": "vt-0b6b717640cb0017e2a8a35873a1d6f4c9c827a3fa07cd8d814bb30536509a35.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The analyzed file, identified as \"NVStRes.dll,\" appears to be benign based on the provided malware analysis details. It is a signed PE32 executable DLL associated with NVIDIA Corporation, specifically identified as an NVIDIA 3D Vision Module Resource DLL. Notably, the analysis results from various antivirus engines did not detect any malicious activity or classify the file as harmful. These engines, such as McAfee, Microsoft, Kaspersky, and many others, reported the file as \"undetected,\" indicating no signs of any malware or security threat associated with this file. In addition, sandbox verdicts, especially from DAS-Security Orcas, categorized the sample as \"harmless.\"\n\nThe file shows no indications of malicious behavior such as persistence mechanisms, encryption or communication with command-and-control servers, nor does it trigger any known YARA rules or MITRE ATT&CK tactics. The timestamps and validity of the certificates suggest an older, legitimate software component, further supporting its benign nature. With no concerning indicators of compromise (IOCs) such as suspicious URLs or IPs, and the lack of community discussions highlighting security risks, the identified behaviors pose no evident risk. As a countermeasure, ensuring all software components and signatures are up to date with the latest security best practices would suffice to mitigate any overlooked vulnerabilities."

    "File Name": "vt-origin_37676__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The analyzed file belongs to the Firseria malware family, as identified by multiple antivirus engines, such as MicroWorld-eScan, CAT-QuickHeal, and Zillya, marking it as Adware or a potentially unwanted application. The file is detected as malicious by 57 different antivirus engines, with specific references to application bundling and adware capabilities. The file is signed with a now-expired certificate, which adds to its suspicious nature despite being verified as 'Signed.' Firseria is typically associated with adware behaviors, often resulting in unwanted software installations, and potentially impacting user privacy.\n\nKey behaviors observed in this malware include system persistence operations and potentially unwanted installations, which are typical for adware, but this file hasn't been reported to be particularly harmful in terms of data extraction or system compromise. As for countermeasures, affected users should use comprehensive antivirus tools to detect and remove Firseria-related files. Implementing browser protections to block unwanted ads and scan downloaded installer files before execution can help in preventing infections. User education on software resources, keeping systems updated, and avoiding unexpected installations are recommended mitigations to avoid such adware infections."

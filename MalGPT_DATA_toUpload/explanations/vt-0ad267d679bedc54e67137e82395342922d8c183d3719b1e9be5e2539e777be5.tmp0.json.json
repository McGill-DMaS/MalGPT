    "File Name": "vt-0ad267d679bedc54e67137e82395342922d8c183d3719b1e9be5e2539e777be5.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file analyzed, \"QQIEHelper.DLL,\" appears to be benign based on the information provided. Despite being flagged by almost all antivirus engines as \"undetected,\" there are no indications of malicious activity, nor has it been classified as harmful by any security entity. The file is signed by Tencent Technology(Shenzhen) Company Limited and verified with a seemingly legitimate, albeit outdated, signature through VeriSign. This lack of detection and classification as a DirectShow filter or Windows ActiveX control suggests normal software components rather than malware.\n\nSandbox analysis also categorized the file as harmless, corroborating the non-malicious verdict. Additionally, there are no associated Indicators of Compromise such as suspicious URLs, IPs, or domains, nor do any YARA rules or known malicious signatures apply to this file. There are no community discussions suggesting problematic behavior, and as such, typical cybersecurity countermeasures, including regular updates and monitoring via reputable security suites, should suffice as mitigation strategies. Given no evidence of persistence, encryption, or data exfiltration behaviors, no specific MITRE ATT&CK tactics or techniques are relevant."

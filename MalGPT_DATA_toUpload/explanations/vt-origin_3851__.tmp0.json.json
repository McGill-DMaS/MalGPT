    "File Name": "vt-origin_3851__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The malware file identified in the given details belongs to the Zoobam family, specifically characterized as a Potentially Unwanted Program (PUP) known as \"DownloadAdmin.\" It is classified as malicious by a wide array of antivirus engines, with 50 engines flagging it as such, including well-known names like Kaspersky, McAfee, Symantec, and TrendMicro, each attributing it to various adware or downloader variants. The executable is noted for its Windows PE characteristics, accompanied by a valid digital signature from Zoobam using a certificate from GoDaddy, which may serve to mislead both users and certain security systems into considering it trustworthy.\n\nKey behaviors of this malware include adware activities and distributing unwanted applications, which may lead to privacy concerns and system degradation. Despite being signed, multiple security engines have consistently identified it as malicious due to its bundling and downloading activities. The file was last submitted for antivirus scanning several years ago, indicating that it might still be circulating among users. As a security measure, it is recommended to remove this application immediately upon detection, employ up-to-date antivirus software to scan for similar threats, and educate users about the risks associated with downloading and installing software from unknown sources. Additionally, implementing group policies and strong application-specific whitelisting could serve to prevent unauthorized installations in enterprise environments."

With 52 malware detections and no harmless assessments, this file stands as overtly malicious.\n\nIn terms of key behaviors, this malware exhibits features typical of backdoors and data stealers, such as creating persistence within the system (a common backdoor trait), potentially establishing command and control (C2) communications, and targeting sensitive information. Though specific URLs, IPs, or domains associated with the malware activity are not identified here, its presence in systems could facilitate unauthorized access and data exfiltration. Mitigation steps include employing comprehensive endpoint protection solutions, utilizing firewalls to monitor and block suspicious outbound connections, and ensuring software and systems are regularly updated to patch vulnerabilities. Community awareness and sharing of threat intelligence are vital in preemptively defending against this type of threat."

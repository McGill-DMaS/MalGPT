    "File Name": "vt-origin_36352__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file \"INHIIFKZ.exe\" is identified as malicious by multiple antivirus engines, predominantly categorizing it within the Morstar malware family. Several engines have flagged it as a variant of application bundler Morstar, which is commonly associated with adware and potentially unwanted program (PUP) activity. The file exhibits high detection rates, with 50 out of recent antivirus analyses confirming its malicious nature, reflected in results such as \"Gen:Variant.Application.Bundler.Morstar.8\" and \"Adware.BundleApp.\" Notably, this malware type often serves as a downloader, facilitating the installation of additional unwanted software.\n\nWithin its technical attributes, the file includes multiple icon resources, which is a typical characteristic of an adware installer masquerading as legitimate software. The signing certificate from \"Vetaform Developments, s.l.\" is no longer valid, further corroborating its illegitimacy. To mitigate its impact, users are advised to keep their security software updated and apply endpoint protection strategies that focus on detecting bundled applications. Additionally, network monitoring for suspicious outgoing connections can help detect and prevent possible communications with command-and-control (C2) servers, limiting the malware's ability to deploy additional payloads or updates. Employing these measures can provide a robust defense against the risks posed by adware like Morstar."

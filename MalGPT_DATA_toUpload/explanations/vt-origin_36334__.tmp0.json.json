    "File Name": "vt-origin_36334__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The analyzed file appears to belong to the \"DownloadAdmin\" malware family, specifically categorized by several antivirus engines as a potentially unwanted application (PUA) or adware. Detected by 47 out of 66 antivirus engines, the file's associated signatures include names such as \"Application.Bundler.KJ\" and \"Win32:Adware-CIX [PUP]\", underlining its malicious intent. A distinguishing feature of this malware is its behavior related to bundler downloads, meaning it might introduce additional unwanted software alongside legitimate installations, posing a risk of further infection.\n\nDespite the legitimate code signing by \"Zoobam\" with a signature verified by notable Certification Authorities like Go Daddy, the file's detection and categorization as riskware across different security engines imply malicious behavior. Observed behaviors in sandbox environments typically include the execution of persistence techniques, registry modification, and interaction with the file system indicative of downloader functions. MITRE ATT&CK tactics potentially associated with this malware include Persistence and Defense Evasion. Countermeasures entail employing reputable antivirus software to detect and remove the malware, while mitigation strategies advocate for network security monitoring and regular software updates to prevent future infections. Given its bundled nature, users should exercise caution when installing software, especially from unverified sources."

The file, categorized as a Win32 executable, utilizes tactics such as software bundling and may compromise a system's security settings. \n\nThe malware's behavior can include persistence mechanisms, file downloading, and system modifications aimed at escalating privileges or modifying the registry for sustained activity. While there are no specific URLs, IPs, or domains provided as IOCs, the infection typically begins with dodgy application download and installation. MITRE ATT&CK tactics potentially linked with such malware could include persistence, execution, and privilege escalation. To countermeasure such threats, ensure your software, especially antivirus programs, are up-to-date and be cautious with unknown software. Mitigation strategies should focus on monitoring application usage and network traffic for abnormal activity and implementing robust application control policies."

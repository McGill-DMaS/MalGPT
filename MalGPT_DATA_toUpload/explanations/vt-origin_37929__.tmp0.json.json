This classification is supported by antivirus engines such as ESET-NOD32, AVG, Avast, and Kaspersky, which highlight the file's nature as adware and a riskware downloader. Of the 63 antivirus engines used for analysis, 48 flagged the file as malicious, revealing a significant detection rate. The file's behavior aligns with adware characteristics, marked by its classification as \"Win32:DownloadAdmin-BE [Adw]\" and similar signatures. The file is signed by \"Code Techno,\" although the certificate is not currently valid, reducing its trustworthiness.\n\nThe primary risk associated with this malware is its capability to download and possibly install additional unwanted or harmful software, as it exhibits attributes typically involved in system infiltration and persistence. Although specific IOCs, YARA rules, sandbox findings, or ATT&CK techniques are not provided, recognizing its adware capabilities implies risks like data collection and unwanted advertisements. Countermeasures should include comprehensive adware and PUA scanning and removal tools, while users are advised to be cautious with software installations and downloads from untrusted sources. Mitigation strategies could involve using reputable antivirus software and regularly updating systems to address known vulnerabilities and prevent similar infections."

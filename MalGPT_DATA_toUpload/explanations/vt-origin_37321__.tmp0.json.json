    "File Name": "vt-origin_37321__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The analyzed file appears to belong to a potentially unwanted application (PUA) family, with several antivirus engines identifying it as adware, download manager, or riskware. Specifically, engines such as Bkav, CAT-QuickHeal, and ESET-NOD32 have flagged it as variations of adware and a downloader. Microsoft has classified it as \"SoftwareBundler:Win32/Dowadmin,\" indicative of potentially risky software that aggregates and installs additional programs without user consent. Notable engine detections also include Symantec identifying it as \"Trojan.Gen.2\" and McAfee with a result labeled as \"Artemis!863B95F9F9E2,\" highlighting its potentially malicious nature.\n\nThe detection statistics reveal that out of all the submissions, 48 were marked as malicious, and 15 remained undetected, with no harmless votes recorded. Despite the absence of concrete Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) like URLs, IPs, or domains, the signatures refer to various detection results by several antivirus solutions as application-specific risks. There are no sandbox-identified behaviors like C2 communication or persistence, nor are there any community discussions shedding additional light on the file. Key behaviors involve unauthorized downloading and potentially disruptive impacts on systems, suggesting cautious measures during deployment or execution. Possible mitigations include restricting execution based on these detections, monitoring system modifications closely for anomalies, and implementing application control to block PUA installations via group policy or security software configurations."

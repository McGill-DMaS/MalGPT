    "File Name": "vt-0ad2f4a1b22970fdc40e50ac2655084a2f6b61fc314ed750e657f7a6849c764d.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The provided file appears to be benign, as it has not been flagged as malicious by any of the antivirus engines listed in its analysis. Out of the 59 engines that inspected the file, none detected it as harmful, and it was reported as \"undetected\" or \"harmless\" across the board. The file, identified as \"AcUt.dll,\" is a Windows Dynamic Link Library associated with AutoCAD, and the presence of dysfunctional signatures and certificates notably from Autodesk, Inc. and VeriSign may have initially raised suspicion. However, these issues are characteristic of an old and possibly legitimate file, indicated by the nature of its signatures being tied to expired certificates.\n\nNo known Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) such as URLs, IPs, or domains are linked to the file, and no YARA rules or specific behavioral signatures are identified in this context. The sandbox results from DAS-Security Orcas categorize the file as clean, emphasizing no observed malicious behaviors, such as unauthorized persistence or communication with command and control servers. Considering the benign verdict and absence of significant warning flags, minimal countermeasures are necessary. Nonetheless, due diligence would involve ensuring that this file instance is required on the system, validating its origin within auto-installed software packages, and consulting Autodesk support if any compatibility or integrity concerns arise. As a precautionary measure, maintaining an updated IT environment and deploying proactive network monitoring would help mitigate unforeseen risks inherent to dated or misconfigured software."

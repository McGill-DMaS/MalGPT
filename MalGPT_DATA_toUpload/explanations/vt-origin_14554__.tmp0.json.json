    "File Name": "vt-origin_14554__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The analyzed file is classified as malicious, primarily identified as a member of the Solimba adware family. This classification can be inferred from consistent detections across multiple antivirus engines, including ESET-NOD32, which identifies it as a variant of MSIL/Solimba.AK.gen, and Kaspersky, labeling it as not-a-virus:AdWare.Win32.Solimba.bk. Notable detections also include names such as Morstar (by BitDefender and F-Prot) and Firseria (by Tencent and Comodo). A substantial number of 49 antivirus engines flagged the file as malicious indicating a high confidence level in this determination. This malware exhibits features typical of adware, including potential unwanted behavior, which often leads to intrusive ads or bundled applications on Windows systems.\n\nNo specific Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) such as domains, IPs, or URLs are mentioned, and there are no reports of sandbox analysis results relating to tactics like persistence, encryption usage, or command and control (C2) server communication. The file is signed by Imbernes Premium s.l., but this signature is either invalid or expired, highlighting a potential trust issue in the execution. For mitigation, users are advised to employ updated antivirus solutions to prevent download or execution of such files. Moreover, practicing caution while downloading software, particularly from unverified sources, can help reduce the risk of exposure to adware. Monitoring network traffic for any unusual activities might assist in early detection of such infections."

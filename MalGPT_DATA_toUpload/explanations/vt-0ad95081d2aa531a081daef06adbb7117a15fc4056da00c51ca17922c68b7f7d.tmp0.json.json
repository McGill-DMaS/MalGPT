    "File Name": "vt-0ad95081d2aa531a081daef06adbb7117a15fc4056da00c51ca17922c68b7f7d.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file analyzed, identified as `mssprxy.dll`, is determined to be benign according to the trusted verdict from Microsoft Corporation, which classified it as \"goodware\". Despite being submitted for analysis 26 times, the file remains undetected by all major antivirus engines, with all analysis reports indicating it as a non-malicious or harmless entity. The file is associated with Microsoft Windows Search and is not linked with any known malware family or suspicious behavior. There are no identifiable Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) such as URLs, IP addresses, or domains, and no YARA rules or signatures have been triggered to suggest otherwise.\n\nThe Sigma analysis summary reports a single high-level rule titled \"Suspicious Call by Ordinal,\" which usually detects DLLs called suspiciously via rundll32.exe. However, this detection appears to be a false positive due to the file's legitimate status. In sandbox testing, no malicious activities such as persistence, encryption, or command and control (C2) communications were observed. Since the file is benign, there are no identifiable MITRE ATT&CK tactics or techniques applicable. Community discussions do not raise any safety concerns regarding this file, substantiating its trusted classification. As a precaution, maintaining up-to-date software and rigorous security monitoring will further mitigate any unlikely risks associated with this file, even though current evidence suggests none exist."

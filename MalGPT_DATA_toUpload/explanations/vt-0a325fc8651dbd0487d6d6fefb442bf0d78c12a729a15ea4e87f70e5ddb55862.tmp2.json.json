    "File Name": "vt-0a325fc8651dbd0487d6d6fefb442bf0d78c12a729a15ea4e87f70e5ddb55862.tmp2.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The analyzed file, identified with the description \"AMD Accelerated Parallel Processing OpenCL 1.1 Runtime\" and attributed to Advanced Micro Devices Inc., appears benign based on the data provided. This executable DLL is associated with AMD's software product, indicating it is likely a legitimate component of the OpenCL framework, used for parallel computing on GPUs. The analysis of its attributes and behavior does not suggest malicious characteristics. Specifically, all examined antivirus engines reported the file as \"undetected\" by using their blacklisting methods, reinforcing its benign status.\n\nGiven the nature of the file as a legitimate library used for computational purposes, there are no identified IOCs (Indicators of Compromise), YARA rules, or unusual sandbox behavior such as persistence or communication to command-and-control servers to report. As it stands, no suspicious community discussions or flagged behaviors are linked to the file. Countermeasures are likely unnecessary as the file shows no signs of malicious intent; however, ensuring that the software package, including this DLL, is obtained from a verified source and kept up to date can mitigate any potential risk of exploitation in altered copies."

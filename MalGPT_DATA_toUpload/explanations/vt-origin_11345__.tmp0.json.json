    "File Name": "vt-origin_11345__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The analyzed file appears to belong to the Morstar malware family, as identified by several antivirus engines, including MicroWorld-eScan and BitDefender, which classified it as a variant of \"Gen:Variant.Application.Bundler.Morstar.30.\" It is also detected as \"Adware.Solimba\" by AV engines like Zillya and Kaspersky, and flagged under other aliases such as \"TrojanDropper:Win32/Sventore\" by Microsoft. With 59 engines marking it as malicious, the file is undoubtedly threatening, primarily operating as a bundler and adware. \n\nWhile there are no specific IOCs, signatures, or YARA rules detailed in the report, the presence of a signed binary with a rich PE header suggests an attempt to mask its malicious operations. The sandbox behavior notes its adware characteristics, which often involve unauthorized software installations and potential system alterations. Unfortunately, no specific MITRE ATT&CK tactics or community discussions are provided; however, the high-level detection necessitates countermeasures such as keeping all systems and antivirus definitions up-to-date, employing network monitoring tools to detect unusual outbound traffic, and user education to avoid suspicious downloads. Possible mitigation includes using application whitelisting and implementing strict access controls to reduce the risk of execution of similar malicious bundles."

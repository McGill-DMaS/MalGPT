The file is detected as malicious by multiple antivirus engines, with 55 out of 70 classifying it as harmful. Notable detections include \"Trojan.DownLoader11.57090\" by DrWeb, \"Gen:Variant.Application.Bundler.Morstar.30\" by BitDefender and F-Secure, \"not-a-virus:AdWare.Win32.Solimba.bi\" by Kaspersky, and \"TrojanDropper:Win32/Sventore.C\" by Microsoft, highlighting its distribution as part of adware or bundling applications. Currently, there are no identified Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) like specific URLs or IP addresses connected to this sample. Although no specific YARA rules or in-depth sandbox behaviors were identified, many engines flagged the file for unwanted software installations, which align with threats targeting user manipulation and privacy invasion.\n\nKey behaviors include attempts to install additional software components without clear user consent, which is a common tactic in such adware. The community discussions predominantly confirm its categorization as a detrimental application with potential risks like system slowdown and intrusion on user privacy by means of unwanted advertisement distribution. Users are advised to implement security patches expediently and facilitate proactive antivirus measures while maintaining vigilance against unsolicited software installations. Mitigation strategies can leverage thorough user education and the regular supervision of system application states to prevent such malware infiltration effectively. Additionally, practicing safe browsing habits and utilizing strong firewall setups can curtail the risks imposed by similar PUA or adware threats."

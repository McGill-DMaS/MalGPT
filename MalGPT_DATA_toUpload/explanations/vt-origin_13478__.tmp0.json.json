    "File Name": "vt-origin_13478__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The analyzed file, identified as \"Mortcerf.exe,\" belongs to the malware families \"Androm\" and \"Loki,\" characterized primarily as a Trojan and ransomware. This classification is supported by the detection results from numerous antivirus engines, with 61 out of 74 categorizing it as malicious. Prominent detections include \"Trojan.Win32.Androm.m\" and \"Gen:Variant.Ransom.Loki.24173,\" indicating the presence of both trojan and ransomware functionalities within this sample. The malicious nature is underscored by associated capabilities such as direct CPU clock access, user input checks, and spreading tactics, suggesting its potential for network propagation and operational complexity. Despite the thorough detection across many engines, no specific associated indicators of compromise (IOCs) such as URLs, IPs, or domains are provided within the report, limiting the contextual intelligence.\n\nThe file indicates no particular YARA rules or community discussions linked, but its signature aligns with typical behaviors of such malware, including persistence mechanisms, potential data encryption, and connections to command and control (C2) servers. The MITRE ATT&CK framework would likely map this to tactics such as \"Lateral Movement\" due to its spreader capabilities and \"Impact\" due to its ransomware elements. This sample poses substantial risks, including data theft and file encryption. As countermeasures, implementing up-to-date antivirus software, restricting administrative privileges, and monitoring for unusual network traffic can mitigate impacts. Employee training on phishing awareness is critical, alongside regular backups, to ensure data recovery in the event of an encryption attack."

    "File Name": "vt-origin_31001__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "This file is identified as malicious and belongs to the malware family 'trojan.msil/androm', with characteristics suggestive of being a part of the Trojan and Dropper categories. It is predominantly flagged by antivirus engines such as Bkav, McAfee, and Kaspersky, among others, showing a high level of suspicion. The file shows significant detections, with 59 engines marking it as malicious. Notably, the file is flagged for behaviors typically associated with malicious software including persistence and spread functionalities, as noted in the tags and the 'spreader' classification.\n\nKey behaviors and risks include the potential for the file to delete \"Zone.Identifier\" ADS using an uncommon process to bypass security settings, aligning with one Sigma rule match for malicious actions. Sandbox verdicts indicate it holds a malicious categorization by Lastline, suggesting potential for persistence and direct CPU clock access. No specific IOCs such as URLs or IP addresses are highlighted, but the presence of an external DNS query for an IP address check is mentioned. Community discussions reinforce its classification as a threat with the use of external resources to retrieve IP addresses. For mitigation, it is recommended to ensure the use of updated antivirus solutions capable of preemptively identifying such threats, and implement strict administrative permissions to restrict unauthorized file actions and modifications."

    "File Name": "vt-0ae6233264a9395d0c25dd04a235ecac570be3ac11067ad6ff41fbe046840c87.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The provided file appears to be benign, as indicated by the sandbox verdict from DAS-Security Orcas, which classified it as 'harmless' and 'CLEAN.' Furthermore, all antivirus engines tested, such as McAfee, Symantec, and BitDefender, did not detect any malicious behavior, as reflected in the 'undetected' category count of 56. No instances of malicious activity are identified in terms of malware family or suspicious behavior patterns. This suggests that the file may be a legitimate component, potentially linked to Mercury Interactive's LoadRunner product, based on its signature information.\n\nThere are no associated Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) such as suspicious domains, IPs, or URLs, nor are there YARA rules or signatures linked to malicious behavior. Sandbox results demonstrate no persistence, encryption, or command and control server (C2) activities. There appear to be no community discussions highlighting risks or malicious behavior of the file. As this file presents no detectable threat, standard security measures in place are adequate, and no specific MITRE ATT&CK techniques are applicable. For mitigation, regular monitoring alongside maintaining up-to-date antivirus software should sustain a secure environment."

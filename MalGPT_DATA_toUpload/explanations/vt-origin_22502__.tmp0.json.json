    "File Name": "vt-origin_22502__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The analyzed file is identified as malicious by numerous antivirus engines, linking it to the DownloadAdmin malware family. This malware is characterized as a Potentially Unwanted Application (PUA) which is commonly associated with deceptive software bundling practices that may also exhibit adware behavior. Out of 70 antivirus engines, 62 flagged the file as malicious, with identifiers such as W32/DownloadAdmin and Adware.Downware. Although the certificate is signed by Code Techno using a now-expired certificate issued by VeriSign, this does not ensure trustworthiness due to its expiration and the file\u2019s malicious status.\n\nThis malware potentially impacts systems by bundling unwanted software, possibly leading to unapproved system changes. Primary risks include privacy intrusions, unauthorized software installations, and system performance degradation. The detection of known YARA rules or sandbox results specifically detailing persistence or command and control (C2) activities is not highlighted in this report, but typical DownloadAdmin behavior may involve generating pop-ups or redirecting web traffic. To mitigate these risks, users should maintain updated antivirus software, exercise caution when downloading software from the internet, and regularly review installed applications for any unwanted software. Employing web filtering solutions to block known malicious domains can further safeguard systems against threats from this malware family."

    "File Name": "vt-0c01347d8119eb8569990315587387909ed710ccd37a4e6e9aac3c87381511e2.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file identified as \"ApplePushService.dll,\" originating from Apple Computer Inc., appears to be benign. Several indicators attribute to this conclusion including widespread non-detection across 73 antivirus engines, reflecting a zero count in both \"malicious\" and \"suspicious\" categories. Sandbox analyses, particularly by DAS-Security Orcas, also categorize the file as \"harmless\". These assessments, combined with the file's nature as a digitally signed component associated with Apple, suggest a low risk of malicious activity. No associated IOCs or suspicious YARA rules were linked to this file.\n\nDespite possessing characteristics such as PE32 executable structure, the file presented no malware-like behaviors such as persistence, encryption, or Command and Control (C2) operations according to the sandbox results and community insights. There's a lack of MITRE ATT&CK techniques association, further supporting its benign status. As a countermeasure, maintaining updated software signatures and monitoring file integrity using security software ensures it remains authentic and unchanged. Additionally, routine audits and leveraging trusted sources for software distribution form effective mitigation strategies to assure system security against potential future threats."

    "Explanation": "The submitted file named \"w3svc.dll\" appears to be part of a legitimate software application, attributed with the trusted verdict of \"goodware\" from Microsoft Corporation, indicating it is a trusted and benign file. It is recognized as part of the Internet Information Services (IIS) product, which Microsoft Corporation distributes. During its analysis, none of the 73 antivirus engines detected any malicious attributes. Known distributors, including Microsoft, further reinforce the file's benign nature. While the file has been flagged as \"undetected\" by the majority of antivirus vendors, no suspicious activity has been associated with it in any sandbox or community discussions, confirming its integrity and intended legitimate use.\n\nThere were no indications of compromise such as URLs, IPs, domains, or YARA rules associated with this file to suggest malware behavior. Sandbox results declared the file as \"harmless,\" and no abnormal behaviors such as persistence, encryption, or C2 communications were noted. Consequently, no specific MITRE ATT&CK tactics or techniques, nor community discussions, pointed towards suspicious activities. As a precautionary measure, ensuring this file remains unaltered by implementing regular system updates and complying with security best practices is an effective protective measure. No other mitigation strategies are currently necessary given its current trusted status."

    "Explanation": "The file in question, identified as \"sqmapi.dll,\" appears to be benign according to the majority opinion from cybersecurity organizations and antivirus engines. The file is attributed to Microsoft Corporation and is described as \"goodware,\" specifically a component of the Microsoft\u00ae Windows\u00ae Operating System. Notably, the antivirus analysis results from engines like Microsoft, McAfee, and Kaspersky categorize the file as undetected for any malicious activities. Furthermore, the results from various sandboxes, including Zenbox, rate it as harmless and classify it under the \"CLEAN\" category. The file's known distributors include Microsoft, which supports its authenticity as a legitimate system file rather than malware.\n\nNo matches for any recognized malware family or signatures are associated with this DLL, as evident from the absence of flagged detection by the antivirus engines listed. There are no known Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), such as URLs, IPs, or domains linked to malicious activities, nor are there any relevant YARA rules or MITRE ATT&CK tactics detected. Community discussions similarly do not identify this file with malicious behavior. As such, no specific countermeasures or mitigation strategies are necessary; however, ensuring that the file originates from verified sources, such as official Microsoft distributions, remains a prudent practice for maintaining system security."

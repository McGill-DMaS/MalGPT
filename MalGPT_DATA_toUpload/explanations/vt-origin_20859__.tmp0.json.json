    "File Name": "vt-origin_20859__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The analyzed file is associated with several malware families, including adware and potentially unwanted programs. Notably, various antivirus engines, including those from Bkav, CAT-QuickHeal, McAfee, and others, have detected this file as malicious, identifying it under names such as W32.HfsAdware.DD11, Artemis!2523A3C4BE9B, and PUA.Codetechno.Gen. These results underscore the file's classification as a security threat. The certificate information associated with the file indicates that one of the certificates used for signing is no longer valid, further contributing to its suspicious nature.\n\nDetection statistics indicate this file was flagged as malicious by 51 engines, with no harmless votes, emphasizing its high-risk potential. The signatures and detection names suggest an emphasis on adware capabilities, and possible unwanted actions include downloader activity as indicated by names like DownloadAdmin.PUA. The reported behaviors do not specify any URLs, IPs, domains, YARA rules, or significant sandbox results, limiting potential intrusion analysis beyond antivirus detection. To mitigate the risk posed by this and similar threats, organizations should maintain updated antivirus definitions, implement strong network security controls to block PUA-related network traffic, and regularly educate users about the risks associated with installing unknown or unverified software."

It is predominantly recognized as being associated with the DownloadAdmin malware family, often flagged by different security solutions under various categories such as adware, riskware, and potentially unwanted programs. This family is known for serving ads, redirecting traffic, and downloading additional software without user consent, making it a risk for user privacy and system security. The file is a PE32 executable designed for Windows systems, evident from its classification as a Win32 EXE.\n\nThere are no explicit indicators of compromise (URLs, IPs, domains) or YARA rules disclosed in the provided information. However, the malware's behavior suggests its involvement in typical download and adware operations, possibly exhibiting persistence mechanisms to remain active in the system. Although there's a lack of specific sandbox results or MITRE ATT&CK tactics linked to the sample, DownloadAdmin variants often focus on privilege escalation and execution persistence techniques. Community discussions on similar threats highlight the importance of keeping security solutions updated and exercising caution with software installations from unreliable sources. Recommended countermeasures include utilizing reputable antivirus software, monitoring system changes for unauthorized actions, ensuring system patches are applied, and educating users on the risks of adware and bundled downloads."

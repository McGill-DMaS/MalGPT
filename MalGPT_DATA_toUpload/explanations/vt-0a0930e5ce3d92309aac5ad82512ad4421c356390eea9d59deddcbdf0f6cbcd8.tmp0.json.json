    "File Name": "vt-0a0930e5ce3d92309aac5ad82512ad4421c356390eea9d59deddcbdf0f6cbcd8.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The provided file, identified by the name \"HttpDown.dll,\" appears to be benign based on the analysis. All antivirus engines from the last analysis report it as undetected, indicating no malicious activity was recognized by any of the 71 antivirus engines queried. The file is digitally signed by Tencent Technology (Shenzhen) Company Limited, although the signature has been marked as invalid due to the revoked status of the certificates. The file classifications suggest it is a typical Microsoft Visual C++ compiled executable, commonly associated with legitimate software applications, specifically identified as part of the QQLive product by Tencent.\n\nNo additional indicators of compromise (IOCs) such as malicious URLs, IPs, or domains are associated with the file, and no specific YARA rules or malicious signatures have been identified. The sandbox verdict from DAS-Security Orcas further confirms its harmless classification. Although the file has tags like \"invalid-signature\" and \"revoked-cert,\" this might occur due to expired certificates rather than indicative of malicious intent. As a possible mitigation, ensure your systems are updated and monitor network traffic for unexpected behavior. Public and community discussions related to this specific DLL do not suggest security concerns, reducing the likelihood of its association with known MITRE ATT&CK tactics or techniques."

    "File Name": "vt-0ae3c8371a0c5f589792c9cd3b0e0fefab13103dc15ce6aa682b31671e54ad26.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The file in question appears to be benign, primarily due to the consistent classification as 'undetected' across 67 different antivirus engines, with no engines reporting it as malicious or suspicious. This broad consensus among multiple antivirus solutions indicates a low likelihood of the file being harmful. Additionally, the sandbox analysis conducted by the DAS-Security Orcas classifies the file as \"CLEAN,\" further supporting its benign nature. The file, identified as \"ICORERM.DLL,\" belongs to the iFIX\u00ae product suite by GE Fanuc Automation Americas, Inc., suggesting that it is a legitimate resource manager DLL rather than malware.\n\nNo indicators of compromise (IOCs), such as URLs, IP addresses, or domains, were associated with this file, and there were no relevant YARA rules or signatures identified. The file's characteristics and behavior do not align with any known MITRE ATT&CK tactics or techniques, and there are no pertinent discussions or comments from the security community to suggest otherwise. As a software engineer DLL, it does not exhibit any behaviors or risks typically associated with malware, like persistence, encryption, or command and control communication. To ensure ongoing safety, regularly update antivirus solutions and consider implementing a whitelisting approach for DLLs in sensitive systems to prevent any potential future exploitation."

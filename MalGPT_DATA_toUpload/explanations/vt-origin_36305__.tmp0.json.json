    "File Name": "vt-origin_36305__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The analyzed file is identified as a malicious software belonging to the \"DownloadAdmin\" PUA (Potentially Unwanted Application) family, characterized by behavior as an adware and downloader. It has been flagged by numerous antivirus engines, including Bkav, Elastic, and McAfee, with a consensus result identifying it as a source of malware. Detection reports indicate that it is likely used for ad-based purposes and to download other potentially harmful components onto the victim's system, posing as a medium risk.\n\nThe file doesn\u2019t provide specific IOCs like URLs, IPs, or domains, nor observed YARA rules or MITRE ATT&CK tactics. However, the executable is notably signed under an invalid certificate, which could suggest an attempt to masquerade as legitimate software. The sandbox analysis hasn't been explicitly detailed in this report, but based on typical behavior of PUAs, it could include processes indicating persistence, potential log collection, or excessive network communications. To counteract the risks associated with this malware type, users should employ robust ad-blocking and PUA mitigation tools, ensure all software signatures are verified and maintain updated antivirus protections. Additionally, user education on avoiding suspicious downloads and websites can mitigate exposure to such malicious files."

    "File Name": "vt-0a1431c70d2e6bf79dafaacc424be53a06aa6820c193df7fa5840036d3467ee0.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The provided file, identified as \"AlmSumMgr.DLL,\" appears to be a benign component rather than malware. The file is described as an iFIX\u00ae Alarm Summary Manager DLL, which suggests its role within the GE Fanuc Automation Americas, Inc. software ecosystem. It is digitally signed, although its signatures have expired or been revoked, which may flag concern in a strict assessment but does not inherently indicate malicious intent. Notably, the file was submitted once and assessed by multiple antivirus engines, resulting in 67 undetected verdicts and zero detections marking it as malicious or suspicious. Additionally, notable security solutions such as Microsoft, Symantec, and Kaspersky have found no indication of malicious activity.\n\nFurther analysis in various sandboxes, including DAS-Security Orcas, classified this DLL as harmless. There are no identified Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) such as suspicious URLs, IP addresses, or domains connected to this file. Moreover, this analysis found no related YARA rules or MITRE ATT&CK techniques and tactics, which underscores the absence of indicators associated with typical malware behavior like persistence mechanisms, encryption encryption routines, or command and control (C2) communications. No significant community discussions or alerts highlight a potential risk, suggesting the file's role is limited to its intended application-based functionality. As a countermeasure and planning for possible mitigation, maintaining up-to-date security signatures and monitoring for unexpected deviations in behavior could preemptively address any remote risk posed by outdated or revoked certificates."

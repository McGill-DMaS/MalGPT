    "Explanation": "The analyzed file appears to be benign, as indicated by the comprehensive results from multiple antivirus engines. All 56 engines reported the file as undetected across various checks, showing no malicious activity or presence of commonly known malware signatures. The file is a 64-bit Windows DLL, tagged under 'pedll,' and was submitted only once, signifying limited distribution or interest from potential attackers. A sandbox analysis conducted by DAS-Security Orcas also classified the file as 'harmless,' confirming the lack of malicious behavior, such as persistence, encryption activities, or C2 communication attempts.\n\nThere are no identified Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) or MITRE ATT&CK techniques associated with this file, further supporting its benign status. The file's metadata reveals it to be a legitimate executable related to Autodesk's AutoCAD Electrical, evidenced by its signature being attributed to Autodesk, Inc. Community discussions or further YARA rule sets have not flagged any suspicious activity or relevance. As there are no apparent risks associated with this file, the key countermeasure would be routine monitoring and updating of security systems to ensure continued verification of such benign files. Regular system updates and antivirus definitions are recommended to maintain an effective defense posture."

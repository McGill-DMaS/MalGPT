    "File Name": "vt-origin_34288__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The analyzed file is identified as malicious and belongs to the Andromeda malware family, also known as Gamarue. Over 60 different antivirus engines confirmed its malicious status, highlighting its nature as a backdoor and Trojan Downloader based on various designations such as W32.AIDetectVM.malware2, Trojan.GenericKD.6292768, and Backdoor.Win32.Androm. The file exhibited standard features associated with Windows executables, such as its type being 'Win32 EXE' with runtime-modules and direct CPU clock access tags. It also has an extensive history, having been submitted multiple times across several platforms. The executable is detected by a broad range of security vendors using traditional blacklist methods, indicating a high confidence in its malicious intent.\n\nThe most notable indicators of compromise (IOCs) are its persistent and adaptable nature, as evidenced by its diverse signature detections across antivirus engines. The malware carries out typical Trojan activities, including establishing a backdoor to allow remote access and control by an attacker. Sandbox results showed the potential for persistence and system modification without user consent, though specific C2 or encryption activities weren't detailed in this analysis. Community forums frequently discuss the Andromeda family, known for its modular capabilities and ability to act as a botnet. To counteract the risks posed by such malware, organizations should maintain updated antivirus definitions, monitor network traffic for unusual activity, and leverage application whitelisting to block unauthorized executables. Mitigation strategies should include regular audits of network shares and implementing network segmentation to limit lateral movement potential by malicious actors."

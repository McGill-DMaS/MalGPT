    "File Name": "vt-origin_15274__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The analyzed file, identified as \"QCFB8CE0.exe\", is classified as malicious, primarily associated with adware and potentially unwanted applications (PUAs). Various antivirus engines have flagged this file under different malware families, including \"W32.HfsAdware.DD11\", \"Application.Bundler.KJ\", \"Trojan.Win32.Generic!BT\", and \"Win32:DownloadAdmin-BE [Adw]\". The file is reportedly signed by \"Code Techno\", but its certificate has expired, undermining trustworthiness. It features characteristics of a Win32 PE executable, with a high probability linked to Visual C++ compiled binaries. The last analysis highlighted 49 malicious detections, with no antivirus engines marking it as harmless or suspicious, indicating a high broad consensus of threat.\n\nThe file shows signs of possible persistence mechanisms by accessing system resources and registry operations, typically indicative of adware behaviors that might include unwanted software installations or browser manipulations. Specific indicators of compromise (IOCs) related to this file are not provided, nor are there explicit YARA rules or sandbox results available in the report. To mitigate risks, it's advised to block the execution of unsigned binaries, implement strict web filtering policies, and employ endpoint protection solutions to detect and prevent adware and PUAs. Regular system audits and updates will also help strengthen defenses against similar threats."

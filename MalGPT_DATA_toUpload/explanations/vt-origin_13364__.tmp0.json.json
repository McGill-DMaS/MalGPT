    "File Name": "vt-origin_13364__.tmp0.json.json",
    "Explanation": "The provided file is identified as malicious, primarily associated with the Andromeda malware family, as indicated by detections from multiple antivirus engines such as Kaspersky and Alibaba, which labelled it as \"Backdoor.Win32.Androm\". This malware type is known for its backdoor capabilities, often used for distributing other malware or executing malicious commands remotely. Notably, the file was detected as malicious by over 50 security products, with results consistent with generic malware and trojan characteristics, evidencing a high confidence in its malicious nature.\n\nKey features identified include the usage of the Enigma packer and the presence of the XORed URL, as captured by a YARA rule \"SUSP_XORed_URL_in_EXE\" from the signature base by Florian Roth. Despite an extensive examination by antivirus engines, no specific URLs, IPs, or domain-based IoCs were reported in this analysis. Some antivirus detections categorized it as a generic malware, indicating that it might employ common tricks like code obfuscation or stealth communication techniques possibly linked to MITRE ATT&CK tactics such as Persistence or Defense Evasion. To mitigate potential risks, it\u2019s recommended to update antivirus definitions regularly, employ endpoint detection and response solutions to monitor for suspicious activities, and adhere to least privilege principles to prevent unauthorized access, particularly on Windows-based systems where this executable is structured to operate."

    "Explanation": "The file \"gvrmgr.dll\" appears to be benign based on the available analysis. This conclusion is supported by the lack of malicious or suspicious detections from 70 antivirus engines, with all categorizing the file as undetected. Additionally, the sandbox verdict from Zenbox classifies the file as harmless with high confidence, indicating no malicious behavior observed during dynamic analysis. The Sigma analysis yielded a low-level rule indicating a user logon with special privileges consistent with administrator privileges, but it does not explicitly associate the file with malicious behavior.\n\nThe file has a legitimate signature by \"iolo technologies, LLC,\" associated with a known product, \"iolo System Mechanic,\" suggesting it is not a component of any known malware family. No indicators of compromise (IOCs) such as URLs, IPs, or domains were identified, and no YARA rules or specific threat signatures were matched. In the absence of identified MITRE ATT&CK tactics or suspicious behaviors, no immediate risks are associated with this file. As a mitigation strategy, users should ensure their software remains up-to-date and continue monitoring security sources for updates on any new vulnerabilities or threats related to this file or product."
